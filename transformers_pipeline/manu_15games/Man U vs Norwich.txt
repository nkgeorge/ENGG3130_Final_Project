Who even needs depth, right
What\u2019s the point of depth if it\u2019s always injured and costs 150k/week?
No back up left back is even close to 190k. I feel like even the top starting lbs are on much lower than that. How can the board be so dumb \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d
Need him for depth, but Williams has definitely stolen his spot.
Spoken like a true FM player. We will RISE
True FM players know depth is important
Still need a backup!
He finally decided to stop picking the safe option and it paid off!\n\nHe might have lost a yard or two but David Silva has shown you don\u2019t need pace to play creatively - you just need to play good, clever passes.\n\nMata for too long has always picked the east or conservative option - back to the midfielders, easy balls out wide - today he went for it and really made things happen.
Yeah, how many times have we criticised Mata for only ever passing eastwards, so glad we're finally seeing him recognising the three other points on the compass
Mata\u2019e best game since December 2018 vs Fulham where he got 1G and 1A\n\nWow
As soon as we scored the two goals after halftime, I couldn't wait to see Greenwood. He shoots, he scores :')
He is beginning to believe!
yeh i was thinking that too. his shots dont seem to have much power on them and keeps often save much harder shots into the corner. \n\nMaybe its the curl and placement.
It's the timing of the shot.
This is exactly what Rooney used to do. He scored from anywhere. But it\u2019s still too early for greenwood to be compared to Rooney.
Yeah, he's much more like van Persie
Luke at this funny guy
Stop calling me Shirley
Don't call me Shawrly.
Come on guys, Williams can't do what he did today against the better sides, and Shaw is still better defensively. Play Williams in these games, sure, but Shaw needs to start against the bigger teams.
The craziest part about that chance was that he wasn't even on the screen when the ball was played forward, he sprinted from about 50 yards away and gave himself a chance.
That's part of the reason he missed it I think, he was just going full pelt and got a little excited
100%, you can train composure in that situation, you can't train the instinct to be in the right place to make that chance
It\u2019s not even necessarily instinct, it\u2019s just sheer effort and determination to make that lung busting run from your own half even though there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll get nothing out of it. Shaw lacks that
What? You absolutely can train that. It's called \"Attacking Positioning\", it's why players who are 25 have better positioning than when they were 5.
Aside from chances, Williams is so much better than Shaw going forward in every single way, and he has adapted to defending in the PL very quickly. Can't believe this is his first senior season, he looks like a finished product.
Luke Shaw's body: \"I'm going to end this man's whole career\"
I laughed, then felt quite sad
Shaw's going to be another one of these players on huge wages that we can't sell. Nobody will pay him half of what he gets at United.
Going forward the club really needs to limit the wages we give players. It's a massive waste of money and doesn't give them proper motivation to actually play.
Which is quite sad, what could have been...
If spurs had literally any other manager I'd say them
Given he\u2019s 19 he\u2019ll need a rest sometimes so maybe not the worst thing lol
durka jaaaabss
Don\u2019t worry, I did too. I remember getting downvoted and told I was being reactionary by saying he is better than Shaw.

Very much agree, when we have tons of possession we need creativity and he's full of it
Lingard living in 2018, Mata living in 2030 with that vision.
He was spraying passes with absolutely perfect precision.
Ronaldinho? Whos that? Only Brazilians on the field were Fredinho and Pereira.
lmao
I can see him leaving in the Summer. His injuries aren\u2019t reliable enough for him to be a backup LB either and his confidence will be shot after losing his spot to a 19 year old, he doesn\u2019t handle pressure well.
Who'd buy him for the insane wage he's on? Yet another Woodward masterclass from last year
I actually burst out laughing at that, it just went straight up \ud83d\ude05
Haha yeah, it surprised me that he missed it that badly \ud83d\ude05
Especially after sprinting 80 yards to get to the back post.  Can\u2019t see Shaw making that run
I think it\u2019s good because he won\u2019t ever miss one like that again. He seems like the type of player to beat himself up over something like that and never repeat it
Yes that is a good point, and with his intelligent runs he will definitely have plenty of scoring opportunities anyways! No way this has an impact on his confidence
\ud83c\udfb6 Build a bonfire build a bonfire, put the glazers on the top, put ed woodward in the middle and you burn the fucking lot. \ud83c\udfb6
Here's a video of the chant you just described  https://mobile.twitter.com/MarvelManUtd/status/1216036973187649536?s=19\n\nAnd here's another clip of a different anti-Woodward chant from today's match \nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/MarvelManUtd/status/1216037041345048577?s=09
Thanks!
Also heard people singing \u201cwe want glazers out say we want glazers out\u201d
He's gonna die, gonna die. Ed Woodward is gonna die\n\nHow we'll kill him I don't know ,\nCut him up from head to toe\n\nAll I know is Woodward's gonna die
Chant against Woodward
Oh right thanks for clearing that up...
What were they?
The correct term is Sweenish
I don't imagine it will be done by tomorrow but that would cap a fantastic weekend
10 points is a sick return still
Aye, not complaining. 4m = bargain
Garner too, thought he'd feature more coming into this season. Guess I was wrong.
He's been injured recently. Just back for the u23s
How son got that one right.
Glad he played instead of Lingard!
He should start against every team that\u2019s going to sit deep and force us to break them down. He\u2019s always looking to make that crucial pass. Case in point the first goal today was all him finding Marcus on the back post.
That one Williams laid off to him wasn't too far out, I think sooner or later he's scoring that goal
He has a good shot and he knows it, but he isnt really ever in a good shooting position so he keeps banging them from 25 yards out from a poor angle or with awkward body positioning.
I remember some pre-season training footage where he smashes one of those top bin. So he is capable of it. Probably why he keeps trying.
Alright, a man must be ambitious.\n\nLet\u2019s aim for 20 UCLs in 10 years, impossible is nothing
Rashford, Greenwood is UCL top scorer, DDG is best keeper since Van Der Sar days, and Ole is a legend from players to managers.\n\nOh i'm looking forward to that.
4gt.... really?
Y
Hahaha glad someone said it.
If that game a week is against a bottom feeder that will sit back and hardly throw anything at us with no pace at all i agree. Even then i don't want him, he is opposite of the direction we are headed in and needs to be moved on.
Who do we have to replace him though?
Fair but we have struggled most in games in those circumstances.
Zlatan did this a few times for us too. All part of being a great finisher, knowing when you have to go for power into the top corner and knowing when you can go for accuracy or sometimes even a pass into the corner of the net.
Zlatans first ever goal for us was like this. Low, in the corner, from outside the box
I would prefer Scott over Fred.
I think Freds better at cleaning up and winning the ball back
Neves
Scott has shown more, more consistently, for longer than Fred. Fred needs to improve further
With a solid squad they should both be rotated in and out anyway. They've both been doing really well.
of course Scott !! Fred hasn't really impressed me tbh
Does it look like he wants to leave to RM though? I don't really believe that, he always tries his best when he plays for us and it's pretty clear he isn't faking an injury. Even Raiola said in december that Pogba is happy at United, but he should have better players around him. Then there was Raiola talking shit about us and I think he just wanted to push our board to improve our squad. I think Paul has got a really good relationship with Ole since he remembers him from his old times at United. I know it's very popular for every magazine and website to talk about Paul leaving, since United right now don't have the ambitions player like Pogba should have, but I can't see him leaving this year.   \n\n\nTo further my point, Real can't afford him (since we don't want their deadwood, they wouldn't give us their youngsters and they seem to be going different way with going for young players. Also, they don't have enough money to buy him) and only other possible teams that could buy him are PSG and Juve. Juve has got enough of midfielders and while they would want him, I don't think they have the money. And PSG are PSG, they probably have the money but Pogba doesn't seem to be interested in playing for Uber league team.
You\u2019ve talked yourself into believing what you want to believe.  \n\nThe only way we will know for sure is if he signs a new contract.  IMO it\u2019s a bad idea to let a guy like Pogba enter the final 2 years of his contract.
I don't think that he will leave.
Raiola has clearly stated that Pogba wants to leave for a better club what makes you think he will stay with us?
Im a pretty big BVB fan and Hakimi wants to go back to real and real want him back so that will be a no go. Plus he is better than Williams tbh so why would we sign him primarily as a backup? If I was ed I would be looking at signing someone like Rousillion or Kurzawa on a free. Cant speak on Reguilon situation though.
Roussillon? Which Roussillon? I'm not sure if  Roussillon would be free in the end of season. \n\nMarcel Halstenberg, Sergio Escudero or Jonas Hector would be good. Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez would be good as a back up.
I know he does, that's why I immediately went to check the footage and it was proven once again that he does so. He does it really well, since the referees usually don't notice it since he is very quick to do so, but it's still against the rules. I think goalkeepers should be penalized for that or at least talked to, it's exactly the same as the wall moving closer to free kick taker.
They said before the season that VAR would not look at the keeper coming off his line on pens.
I think that that rule sucks, the taker already has an amazing advantage over the keeper.  A step to decrease the angle should never be punished
Swedish commentator said he has saved 4 out of 26 penalties he's faced in the PL
It is really strange that he can get away with that. I mean, everybody knows he does that, referees should watch him carefully for that. Or the rule should be completely removed if you don't get punished if you do it well.
Totally ruining MOTD for me!
Mate so true.
You underestimate my hand, good sir!
Necrophilia is a punishable crime, dear sir!
260 PL goals, no? He played in the Old First Division too I believe
Yeah that's what I thought - but he's definitely not the record holder if you include Old First Division...
Perhaps you\u2019re right. I just took the number from Wikipedia
Selling Shaw is a big no no. He's reliably above average all the time, case in point - the entire last season
Your average bar is very low then. I'd even keep young instead of Shaw.
Yeah. Every game I see him I see good runs and creative genius. He might not work against top6 because of lack of possession but the rest of the league he is fucking world class tbh
Juanfield <3
Good runs and good ideas. You are just not looking mate
What good run Mata barely runs
Because he's shown that he can't for most of this season.
Hes had plenty of games this season where he hasnt done the job this is literally his first good game this season
Think Rashfords was harder to miss tbh. At least for Williams the bounce and the angle were against him. Rashford just mistimed his.
Agreed, it was a wonderful pass and as you say it hasn\u2019t happened for a long time. I feel that the strikers often make these runs but the midfield don\u2019t see it as much.
the other great thing was both rashford and martials goals were in the 6 yard box. Good to see them both in the actual box to receive a cross.  \nPlenty of times this season we have seen the crosses come in and no one there!
It was something they did in training the day before and that says a lot
One that comes to mind is AP vs VIlla but that was quite a while ago
Lingard has just been bad. Mata has been mostly bad with the occasional good performance. If Mata played every game as well as he did today we'd be 3rd. They're both just so inconsistent, I don't think either are united quality.
you can't say because of one good game that Mata clearly isn't good enough. Hes slow, he has poor acceleration, agility and top speed. His passing and intelligence doesn't make up for it.
Didn't say that.
Oh I am sure they get the title. Just want them to lose one ASAP. Can't have them wining the title unbeaten.\n\nBut agree on the Spurs point.
We will end their unbeaten run next week\ud83d\ude09
We might as well beat them next week then
Awful tactics from Jose as well lul
Spurs have been hammering them the last 20 minutes now though, but they definitely miss Kane.  Lo Celso definitely should have pulled them even
No doubt. The New manager appeal is over.
Spot on. Theyve done fuck all since Poch's sacking lol. Zero noteable results
We're also managing an aging Mata well.
hopeful  about seeing more of Gomez in next few games
\u201cJa well the rain, you know, the rain was really slippery, and when it\u2019s hard to control the ball, you cannot win..!\u201d
Just re-watching the goals now. How he was in that position for Rashford to play him in I will never know but it was a brilliant bit of play between them and intelligent from Williams.
Ah, the City approach. Please Ed, sign a Belgian cycling doctor this january
Give him a role as a club ambassador. Just travelling around speaking about United in a positive way. Visiting schools and hospitals etc. Perfect job for him and easy PR for United.
Although I do not doubt that that is a role he could play very easily, I want him to be involved on the technical side, on the training ground with the youth and even the U23s.
Not just his vision,  his movement is some of the best in the team.  He's always running into space,  he's always there when someone needs an outlet
He\u2019s not gonna roast management to the press. Let\u2019s be honest
That man knows how to talk.
In fact, such positive reinforcement might prompt Ed to give him a midfielder like Bruno.\n\nSlagging him like Mou did certainly didn\u2019t work.
And we won
Or maybe us winning was down to the collective effort of the team and when we loose its down to the collective effort of the team ??
Right. That\u2019s why I have no issues with him missing that chance. We\u2019ve seen rashford do it several times this season already and it\u2019s not like Shaw would have even been there for that chance. He\u2019ll bang in the next one.
Part of me wanted the goal so much so he already doubled Shaws career scoring output
Young, too. His mistakes are forgivable, but I do hope his decision-making moving forward becomes better.
Spent regrettably long figuring out what Ashley had to do with this haha
MANEY TEAM\n\nMANEY MANEY MANEY MANEY MAAAAANEY
Don't forget MAson
As we were 3 goals up. I laughed out loud at that attempt. Dude will not be sleeping tonight :D \n\nHe was awesome today though. Still. I see some banter from the team at Williams.
He's young, he'll learn...
Yep would have been a nice highlight on a great performance.
A bit odd seeing how we desperately need a number 10.\n\nIf only either Mata or Gomes somehow fit in, they both can do it but weirdly don\u2019t.
I personally woult Matic leave, he is playing now(and he is doing OK) but because Mctom and Fred and injured and even Garner has been injured. It's true that we need midfielders and if he leaves we should sign another one more so if he keeps playing like that I can see staying more 1-2 more years but the ideal situation would be leave him and sign a replacemente.\n\nAnd yes Gomes could have an assist today, I have high hopes on him and I'm really happy he is playing again, hope he renews the contract now he seems to be a first team choice again
>I personally woult Matic leave,   \n\nSorry, my baf, should have clearer. We can trigger an extension in his contract for another year.
Yep! I didn't even think Andreas was bad today, but he wasn't \"good.\" He was average. Didn't make any mistakes but didn't really offer much either. Bruno would be a massive upgrade.
Andreas has at least had a decent string of games now. I think he would make a decent rotational option. Much better than Lingard at least
Ole is going to do a Fergie here.
I really want that to happen
Is it too soon for me to call Olebabes ?
I really hope so!
And we can clearly see that he is going the right way. Coming off the bench, score, and repeat.
You wouldn't Bruno can play at CM but he's predominantly a 10, so it would be Pereira or Mata (or *shudder* Lingard) making way from the starting 11 on any given matchday
Nothing wrong with playing two 8s instead of a 10 though. (God these fifa terms are so obnoxious)
Extremely so, Mctominay is good however I rank Matic a level above him as a DM who dictates our defence.
Who?
Rio mentioned that his legs didn\u2019t have much left towards the last couple of years at the club. SAF used to play him sparingly but to good effect. Then Moyes played him in back to back games week after week and his performance dropped off, resulting in him getting shipped out. \n\nMatic is in the same boat right now.
Hes played every game since the newcastle game no? The one attempt at resting him he played 45 anyway. The issue isnt so much fitness, as much as the speed and intensity of the games hes in. There will be some high intensity games where he simply cant keep up, i have a feeling that the liverpool game is one such instance.
We'll buy Maddison for 100 million, Leicester will buy Cantwell for peanuts, and somehow in two years Cantwell will be better. Of course, if we buy him he'll burn out and flop.
Van Dijk loves doing that as well tbf.
Exactly, so many good things
People expect immediate change when that\u2019s not what a rebuild is. A rebuild can take up to 3-4 years if you do it properly. Unfortunately what these people don\u2019t understand is that we have done none of it properly since fergi left. Like you said people just need to have more patience.
Np, I hope it'd his last game to wave goodbye, recent report their president(whoever came) went back already, speculations:left hanging.. Hope it's done deal tho just waiting after game..
What makes you think that!?
I don't know man. I just doubt that competence of the people in charge of buying players.
Especially Mahrez. With Kante I understand why we missed out but we could've had Mahrez before City did and he probably would've been amazing for us
but can he play LW? (Woodward, probably)
Thanks for the info
Yes and no. If Lingard leaves he's basically in the same spot he is now, but he's starting to get game time now. Also, given Bruno's versatility Angel could still play at 10 with Bruno and Fred behind until everyone is fit.
But giving him gametime is dependent on him signing a contract, and currently we haven't given him a reason as to why he should sign.
Gomes is not helping himself much by not signing a contract. i think if he had a contract then ole would have been more up to giving him a chance but when he is unsure of the desire of the player to be here in the future then he rather give chances to the ones that are committed to the team.
It's a two way street, we only got to this mess because he only got two appearances last season despite Ole mentioning our youth every other conference last season. \n\nIt's too late now with Bruno coming in anyway.\nTime to move on.
Hahah fair shout, it just seemed like a reasonably serious chat
[deleted]
Yeah im takin the piss, it did look like he was talking a lot
Shhhhhh
Actually Fred is pretty good against the big teams.\n\nHe was top class against Spurs and City, also pretty good last year at PSG away.
totally
Yeah. He performed better than his average level today. I just hope he keeps it up for big games.
Created 3 chances, more than mata
Haha yeah. Rashford's first goal is a proper poacher's goal. But I'm sure you know that Rashford is more of a mix of strength (powerful shots), a bit of skill (not every dribble pans out for him; I wager that his dribbling skill is not as good as Martial), and pace. \n\nWe need someone who can consistently poach (like Aubameyang or our Chicharito/RvN).
Well...we have seen it time and time again that some players just don't perform as well as they did in their old league when they moved to PL. I'm not saying PL is superior or whatever. But from what I see in the highlights (yes, highlights only), he is probably going to struggle in PL (and might be a bit overrated). Trust me, I want everything in the world for Bruno or whoever ends up joining us to be successful. But if you read my comments about our team throughout the years, I've been very realistic (and pessimistic if you will interpret it that way).
That is always a risk, but we can't keep believing it could never work. I don't think there's a single top league in the past 5 years that we haven't bought a flop from. \n\nDoubt a player because of the league he comes from we might as well buy nobody.
Great, thanks :D
World class is WAY a bit much.\n\nHe played better against what is the worst team in the EPL. And he stilled got dribbled on twice in the game.\n\nOle plays Matic and Mata in games like this because he knows their experience will benefit them, despite being older and slower than the average EPL player.\n\nAnd right now we don't have much of anyone else to play in Matic's spot.\n\nHis statistical rating in the last few games is very average. Especially compared to how he played against Leicester earlier in the year. But he is NOT a Top 4 team starter in the EPL. \n\nYesterday he played better - he played WELL - (and scored easily his highest statistical rating) against what is the worst team in the EPL. That's really all it was.
I never seen him as a pure CDM, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s that defensive orientated compared to how good he is at carrying the ball forward and picking the right pass and moving. When he first joined Chelsea I remember him being all over a prime Yaya Toure and winning that box to box battle. I think his legs are gone a bit but yesterday he did look a lot more sharp than he has for a long time, hopefully he\u2019s over some injuries and can sustain it.
Hmm, I know City had taken their foot off the gas at 3-0, but he did well to steady the ship there, maybe he could do the same against Pool. Thing Ole needs to look at is all of the 50:50 balls against Spurs on Saturday. The Liverpool players got to them like they were possessed, so quick to react and absolutely busting a gut to make sure they won any loose balls and recycled it into attack.
Yeah it is, but I just can\u2019t be bothered with the irrational negativity that completely takes over
Of course, we didn't need him, but there was a lot of situations that would have been either a goal or a dangerous shot if there was someone with better decisions, that's why I immediately thought of Bruno. It just shows how well our team in general worked today. But yeah, I agree that Bruno is needed much more for mid table teams.
Financial reasons, Sporting are genuinely a bit of a mess. \n\nEven their fans are certain he's going, which says a lot.
He's removed Sporting from his insta bio if that's any indication
Yea but Tot can always snatch him
Aye, and he\u2019s signed a new contract since then too, doesn\u2019t add up
It wasn't an extension, it was just higher wages for not getting a move in the summer. Can you people stop going crazy just because there weren't any reliable sources during a matchday and now a sunday? Jesus christ.
But, hey, at least there's Neves.
The thread refers to Virgil at the \u201cDutch Phil Jones\u201d and sending him back to Celtic
oh my bad, fuck em both tho
Guilty
i love that
Thanks for the replies, great to see such a complete performance as well as Mata pulling some strings!
Not sure about Sancho happening,He would most likely prefer to go live in London !
Bruno+Grealish+Buendia can be payed off with the Pogba transfer fee!
I fancy Neves
I mean he\u2019s 27. Not that old
Allan is 29
Yeah, I'll have to take one for the team on sunday.
No, you will do it naturally
So did you watch the game against wolves?
You know what you gotta do, man.
Agreed that\u2019s why I\u2019m a little late to the party on him. His strengths are what we\u2019ve been missing though so he\u2019s becoming an important player for us.
MMMM
But his creativity, we're missing that in thos team, someone with Mata's vision and speed eould be immense
Bro I know what you're trying to say, but Mata's vision and *speed?* Mata is slow as a snail, what are you even trying to imply
Come on Jose!
Stone is Woodward's mouthpiece. I still don't think we're going to sign anyone this window and Woodward is feeding out this Bruno news to distract the fans
How do you distranct fans from transfer news with transfer news?
Makes sense
That would just make things worse - that will give the impression that we've failed to get *another* signing over the line under Woodward which is a big criticism fans have of him. \n\nAlthough... I could believe he's just stupid enough to think that dangling a carrot will make the fans like him even after he snatches it away.
That's been true since 2014.
Martial Blind Fellaini Mata all been key in our trophy wins
i get that, but it would be sweet though. rashford is easily our best forward right now.
And rightly so.  We need him and Martial in every match.  Happy to see them get subbed for some rest.
God I hope so
i meant the premier league as a whole, not just united.
Oh okay, I thought you meant just at United. I don't know the answer then, unfortunately, but he surely has to be up top. He might be not be the best one at that, after all City score a lot from time to time and they have got stacked bench, I could see either Aguero or Jesus being up there. I might try to look for the stats somewhere
He didn't? Thats a bummer
Because he was an import. Bellingham is 16 so there isn't a contract to pay out. \n\niirc we didn't get paid from West Ham when they signed Odubeko.
oh...
Yeah Mata too.\n\nThough his first assist shows the importance for a player that has good vision and passing
Honestly, any player with good vision and passing is necessary for any side to function. And our lack of it is one of the reasons why we've looked rather toothless throughout the season. But sadly, Mata isn't that player anymore. He still comes up with the goods when the game is as slow as it was today but looks a proper passenger when it gets stretched.
Absolutely. Love it.
But man oh man, those deadly crossing
I wonder if he could adapt his game like Giggs did when he got older. With his vision and intelligence he could be quite useful still!
that was away i think
Damn then west brom? The 5-5 game?
Cardiff was away though
That definitely seems possible. Been getting knackered in almost every game he's played. He seems physically okay but never know how its affecting him mentally.
Depends how you look at it. Grealish is a proven PL player and won't need any time to adapt
So was Sanchez...
Bruno is massive for our Europa League campaign, and hopefully Champions league soon
Yea why the fuck did u get downvoted? Your question is perfectly fine imo.
Haha idk. I was hoping for some insights and opinions but that was asking for too much from some
That's my feeling too. I guess I was trying to ask if they could play together or if they're a like for like player that would be competing for a spot.
70 odd million for rotation ?
No way on earth a relegated player costs that much.
He's still doing that against most teams now, since he's the only one in the Villa side capable of doing anything. You only need to watch how well he carries the ball forwards to see that he's natural at it. \n\nWe'd never be able to get him on a loan, the only way we're gonna get him is if they get relegated (which there's a good chance of) and then he'll likely pine to stay in the PL, and they'll need the money from dropping down a league. They'd never accept a loan for their best player
Agreed. He's been decent, but he needs to have better decision-making in defense and in transition.
Thought this as well especially in the first half, but this is probably because we have a makeshift midfield of Matic, Fred, and Pereira. We need someone better on the 10.
I mean, great result and performance today aside, not making tactical changes in game is bad a philosophy for a manager to have.
Apologies, I don't think I explained myself that well. Its that he doesn't feel the need to have a Klopp style of management where he is on the sideline yelling instructions at all the players.
Not challenging this too much but have you got a quote for this? Pretty big thing for a manager to say TBH
I can't find the quote tbh so feel free to take what I said with a grain of salt.
Would be brilliant, especially with that bare bone midfield we have. Would rather Spurs make them look a bit more human by giving them the first loss first though.
[deleted]
The club hierarchy doesn't care about us.
It was a game in the league, not a league cup game. Not meaningless at all
A decent few days to recover so I\u2019d imagine we\u2019ve got it.
It's on Wednesday
It's not about being a downer it's about people realising the problem we are in isn't sorted by beating Norwich. And hyping players performances and being shit on those that didn't play this game means nothing on the whole and enough of one game deciding people's opinions whether a player is good or bad and if they are worthy of playing more games.\n\nEvery result needs to be taken in context Norwich are a poor side and don't just sit back allowing us to take advantage of how poor they are.
I didn\u2019t want to sound negative but I had to put it out there. It\u2019s alright if people disagree. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s his best offensive game. He\u2019s still young and there is a long way to go, no worries at all
We can agree that he is improving then I hope.\nI would have taken him for hes amazing defensive ability. Everything else is a bonus.
knee jerk negativity, sure! Knee Jerk positivity is always what happens on this sub and then people go the other extreme abusing the players and manager
You keep writing the same comment
Lmao I bet people like u cheer for 1-2 to Huddersfield too. \n\nStop copy pasting that same old gatekeeping shit sentence, if he wants to criticize an underperforming team he can do that without lazy trolls like u undermining it with no proper reasoning or furthering of the discussion, fuck off.
Bro you need a nap
Are you ever happy?
Agreed. I was like \"why is this downvoted?\" Then i got to the anti-Fred part and i went \"oh, here's my downvote\"
Absolutely love his passion. Now that he\u2019s had this run of games we can finally see his ability. It\u2019s all clicking for him
You seen my U-23 team?
The U-23s ARE our depth
That and the ball was bouncing a little bit
Yeah
That's why I support the process that has started under Ole. Sign young players who dream of playing for Man United. Offload the mercenaries who come here for a big pay cheque. We need to be back in the Champions League ASAP though so that we can attract good players without paying them massive wages.
Indeed. The night he broke his leg was so awful. He was brilliant before that.
Tottenham are in a dire need for a decent LB which Shaw is. I honestly still rate him and we need the depth. \n\nWe don't have another LB at all... Laird? Young? Dalot? - RB, Gone, RW
The very notion of Mourinho buying Luke Shaw.
Spurs are stingy with money.\nYoung is leaving.\nLaird is RB and still very raw.\n\nDalor prefers RB too.
Between Mourinho working with Shaw again and Levy looking at his insane wages...yea that's not gonna happen
Thanks!\n\nAny idea what they was saying in the second. Can't catch it.
\"how we'll kill him I don't know, cut him up from head to toe, all I know is Woodwards gonna die\".
Lol, /u/poppinKREAM coming in with the sources
**CHANTS AGAINST WOODWARD**
(\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0\uff09\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b
The one against Bournemouth?
I think it's great that we're debating which one is *better* instead of which one is *worse*, ya feel me?
Maybe a bit, but it still doesn't change the fact that currently there isn't a lot of clubs that could actually afford to buy him without including an actually usable player in the deal.  \n\n\nBut yeah, I agree with that. We will just have to wait and see. I really think he wants to be succesful here and win trophies. But even Raiola himself said Paul needs better players around him. That's why I think we are in a similar situation to the one we were in last year with Dave. He didn't sign new contract until it was very clear we got AWB and we were nearing the signing of Maguire. I guess this will be the same - if we sign better players for the midfield and we improve, Pogba stays. If we show no ambitions, he will leave (probably not this year, but maybe next one).
Has he though? I am sure I haven't seen anything like that. If you could link me where he said that, I'd be happy to check it out.
He said something along those lines near the summer (either him or pogba) but nothing recently
Ok, thank, I didn't know that. I guess it makes sense, but still, the referee should have seen that. At least the goal line officials should make sure things like these don't happen.
Yes, the ref can decide if there should be a retake, but I think the rule is ignored unless there is an extreme case.
Yeah, but that's the way it should be. After all, it should be a punishment for fouling an oponent in a very promising situation. I'm fine with requiring the goalkeepers to be on the line when the penalty is taken, but I don't like the way it works now, since it's just based on luck whether you get away with going against the rules or not.
It\u2019s still unsaveable if it\u2019s a good take though, even if the gk does step early
Damn, I'm fucked!
Oh really? That I did not know. Who is it then?
Must be Jimmy Greaves I think... I'm sure he got around 350 or so!
Players like Young and Mata are needed because of their experience and the composure they offer especially against bigger sides.
I'm not sure you've watched us play
Mata  just doesnt effect games 9 times out of 10 this is his first good game this season , he is also slow and one footed and doesn't press at all he comes off the bench for a reason
Against\nYou are not watching then
I will pay all my savings to see that, ok not all but most of it \ud83d\ude01
One can hope but I am not putting money on it. They are unbeaten at home for what feels like an eternity now.
Yeah they just don't seem to lose. It's annoying
They were playing hoof ball to 5 7 Lucas Moura for the first hour, this one is on jose
14 shots vs Liverpool's 13. Only lost 1-0 and were still in the game. All while missing their best player as well as captain. Also a full debut to a defender.\n\nBut go on...
Playing two 8s would still mean the current player at 10 would be the one to make way, which is the point I'm making.\n\nAlso the FIFA terms are CDM (6), CM (8), CAM (10) which in my opinion are far more vague
10s and 8s are a fifa term?
CM
We have given him plenty of reasons to sign. Examples: McTominay, Williams. Just to name a few.
Williams only had Shaw as his competition, Mctominay been a regular for a season but probably would have played a lot less if we replaced Herrera.\n\nWhile Gomes has 3 players ahead of him with a 4th coming in
hahaha what the fuck
Harry ~~Potter~~ Maguire erotica
Same after Tonys goal.
Maguire went for the header when Tony scored and their heads collided. I'm assuming he said something about that.
I really do hope I'm wrong about my initial lukewarm assessment of Bruno IF we buy him soon. Let's see if we can even get him first.\n\nP.S. Just want to reiterate that I'm not saying buying from other leagues is risk prone at all. I am saying in Bruno's case, the defense style and quality in Portugal league might not be comparable to other top leagues (I'm now curious to find out how many total goals by all clubs have been scored annually in different leagues across EU).
If there was a sniff of him I\u2019d take him, be daft not to snap him up considering how well he\u2019s done at wolves and his age
I did, I broke the curse.
I dont expect you to turn on your tv on Sunday then\n\nYou are doing good work
A player with his vision but with some more speed, we need someone like that in this team. A new signing! With these attributes.
Slow feet fast mind
And I think he just meant speed, not necessarily Mata's speed.
And how many flops we got ?
Because Jones Smalling Shaw have been nothing but successes haven't they
yea it's pretty insane how lethal he is. I'm just so happy that we have such a gem in our hands right now.
Ok, I have done an extensive and exhausting research through Transfermakt. de and take this with a pinch of salt, since I went through a lot of players, but it looks like this:\n\n3 goals from bench - Mason and Harry Wilson (Mason has 414 minutes played, Wilson 1016)\n\n2 goals from bench - Lys Mousset, Oliver McBurnie and Jay Rodriguez (Mousset has 881 minutes played, McBurnie has 887 and Rodriguez has 769)\n\nIt is actually insane how good his goal tally is when you consider he is 18 years old.
Away as well
Away
Grealish won\u2019t fail because his legs are gone. I\u2019ll tell you that for free.
Grealish's legs are massive
Has it been determined that hes eligible to play in the Europa league this season?
You forgot the United Tax, mate.
Why? Because I don't find it funny that u ruin this sub with downvotes and troll spam? \n\nGtfo m8, come back when u have anything to say about Man U or related, don't care much about anything else u could say.  \n\nBut looks like u got nothing to say lol.
Yeah pretty happy most of the time, just because I dont mind calling out some weak minded jackass on the net when he's clowning around doesn't mean I'm unhappy lmao, or did I hit a nerve?
You look like such a dick hahaha
Yikes. Fuck Woodward and fuck the Glazers, but singing about cutting him up makes me uncomfortable.
That's a bit fucked up
Yeah, I know about last summer, but there was a lot of unknowns and since then, the situation seems to have calmed down.  That's why I was curious and wanted to know where he got his informations, since Raiola has stated that Pogba is happy at the club and just wants better players around him.
This is exactly the reason I think it's kind of stupid. Either always make sure the keeper is on the line, or don't ever check it. I don't like the little differences the referees can make in each match. You might get away with it in one match and then the penalty gets retaken in a different match. I don't like the inconsistency.
It depends. If you hit it directly next to the post, there is much higher chance the goalie will save it if he is half a meter or a meter closer to the ball. He can't get there if he jumps from the line, but he can do so if he is closer to you. I know that the player taking the penalty still has the advantage, but it isn't as big of an advantage if the goalie is off the line.
You are correct. He is first at 357 and Shearer 5th at 283. Wayne Rooney at 208 doesn't even break Top 20. Incredible!
The last 30 minutes was good, but why ignore the first 60 that were dreadful.
Exactly.
Set piece goal \u2705
FC United of 4 goals
FC 4 Goals is the Chinese knock off brand
Who even needs depth, right
What\u2019s the point of depth if it\u2019s always injured and costs 150k/week?
No back up left back is even close to 190k. I feel like even the top starting lbs are on much lower than that. How can the board be so dumb \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d
Need him for depth, but Williams has definitely stolen his spot.
Spoken like a true FM player. We will RISE
True FM players know depth is important
Still need a backup!
He finally decided to stop picking the safe option and it paid off!\n\nHe might have lost a yard or two but David Silva has shown you don\u2019t need pace to play creatively - you just need to play good, clever passes.\n\nMata for too long has always picked the east or conservative option - back to the midfielders, easy balls out wide - today he went for it and really made things happen.
Yeah, how many times have we criticised Mata for only ever passing eastwards, so glad we're finally seeing him recognising the three other points on the compass
Mata\u2019e best game since December 2018 vs Fulham where he got 1G and 1A\n\nWow
As soon as we scored the two goals after halftime, I couldn't wait to see Greenwood. He shoots, he scores :')
He is beginning to believe!
yeh i was thinking that too. his shots dont seem to have much power on them and keeps often save much harder shots into the corner. \n\nMaybe its the curl and placement.
It's the timing of the shot.
This is exactly what Rooney used to do. He scored from anywhere. But it\u2019s still too early for greenwood to be compared to Rooney.
Yeah, he's much more like van Persie
Luke at this funny guy
Stop calling me Shirley
Don't call me Shawrly.
Come on guys, Williams can't do what he did today against the better sides, and Shaw is still better defensively. Play Williams in these games, sure, but Shaw needs to start against the bigger teams.
The craziest part about that chance was that he wasn't even on the screen when the ball was played forward, he sprinted from about 50 yards away and gave himself a chance.
That's part of the reason he missed it I think, he was just going full pelt and got a little excited
100%, you can train composure in that situation, you can't train the instinct to be in the right place to make that chance
It\u2019s not even necessarily instinct, it\u2019s just sheer effort and determination to make that lung busting run from your own half even though there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll get nothing out of it. Shaw lacks that
What? You absolutely can train that. It's called \"Attacking Positioning\", it's why players who are 25 have better positioning than when they were 5.
Aside from chances, Williams is so much better than Shaw going forward in every single way, and he has adapted to defending in the PL very quickly. Can't believe this is his first senior season, he looks like a finished product.
Luke Shaw's body: \"I'm going to end this man's whole career\"
I laughed, then felt quite sad
Shaw's going to be another one of these players on huge wages that we can't sell. Nobody will pay him half of what he gets at United.
Going forward the club really needs to limit the wages we give players. It's a massive waste of money and doesn't give them proper motivation to actually play.
Which is quite sad, what could have been...
If spurs had literally any other manager I'd say them
Given he\u2019s 19 he\u2019ll need a rest sometimes so maybe not the worst thing lol
durka jaaaabss
Don\u2019t worry, I did too. I remember getting downvoted and told I was being reactionary by saying he is better than Shaw.

Very much agree, when we have tons of possession we need creativity and he's full of it
Lingard living in 2018, Mata living in 2030 with that vision.
He was spraying passes with absolutely perfect precision.
Ronaldinho? Whos that? Only Brazilians on the field were Fredinho and Pereira.
lmao
I can see him leaving in the Summer. His injuries aren\u2019t reliable enough for him to be a backup LB either and his confidence will be shot after losing his spot to a 19 year old, he doesn\u2019t handle pressure well.
Who'd buy him for the insane wage he's on? Yet another Woodward masterclass from last year
I actually burst out laughing at that, it just went straight up \ud83d\ude05
Haha yeah, it surprised me that he missed it that badly \ud83d\ude05
Especially after sprinting 80 yards to get to the back post.  Can\u2019t see Shaw making that run
I think it\u2019s good because he won\u2019t ever miss one like that again. He seems like the type of player to beat himself up over something like that and never repeat it
Yes that is a good point, and with his intelligent runs he will definitely have plenty of scoring opportunities anyways! No way this has an impact on his confidence
\ud83c\udfb6 Build a bonfire build a bonfire, put the glazers on the top, put ed woodward in the middle and you burn the fucking lot. \ud83c\udfb6
Here's a video of the chant you just described  https://mobile.twitter.com/MarvelManUtd/status/1216036973187649536?s=19\n\nAnd here's another clip of a different anti-Woodward chant from today's match \nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/MarvelManUtd/status/1216037041345048577?s=09
Thanks!
Also heard people singing \u201cwe want glazers out say we want glazers out\u201d
He's gonna die, gonna die. Ed Woodward is gonna die\n\nHow we'll kill him I don't know ,\nCut him up from head to toe\n\nAll I know is Woodward's gonna die
Chant against Woodward
Oh right thanks for clearing that up...
What were they?
The correct term is Sweenish
I don't imagine it will be done by tomorrow but that would cap a fantastic weekend
10 points is a sick return still
Aye, not complaining. 4m = bargain
Garner too, thought he'd feature more coming into this season. Guess I was wrong.
He's been injured recently. Just back for the u23s
How son got that one right.
Glad he played instead of Lingard!
He should start against every team that\u2019s going to sit deep and force us to break them down. He\u2019s always looking to make that crucial pass. Case in point the first goal today was all him finding Marcus on the back post.
That one Williams laid off to him wasn't too far out, I think sooner or later he's scoring that goal
He has a good shot and he knows it, but he isnt really ever in a good shooting position so he keeps banging them from 25 yards out from a poor angle or with awkward body positioning.
I remember some pre-season training footage where he smashes one of those top bin. So he is capable of it. Probably why he keeps trying.
Alright, a man must be ambitious.\n\nLet\u2019s aim for 20 UCLs in 10 years, impossible is nothing
Rashford, Greenwood is UCL top scorer, DDG is best keeper since Van Der Sar days, and Ole is a legend from players to managers.\n\nOh i'm looking forward to that.
4gt.... really?
Y
Hahaha glad someone said it.
If that game a week is against a bottom feeder that will sit back and hardly throw anything at us with no pace at all i agree. Even then i don't want him, he is opposite of the direction we are headed in and needs to be moved on.
Who do we have to replace him though?
Fair but we have struggled most in games in those circumstances.
Zlatan did this a few times for us too. All part of being a great finisher, knowing when you have to go for power into the top corner and knowing when you can go for accuracy or sometimes even a pass into the corner of the net.
Zlatans first ever goal for us was like this. Low, in the corner, from outside the box
I would prefer Scott over Fred.
I think Freds better at cleaning up and winning the ball back
Neves
Scott has shown more, more consistently, for longer than Fred. Fred needs to improve further
With a solid squad they should both be rotated in and out anyway. They've both been doing really well.
of course Scott !! Fred hasn't really impressed me tbh
Does it look like he wants to leave to RM though? I don't really believe that, he always tries his best when he plays for us and it's pretty clear he isn't faking an injury. Even Raiola said in december that Pogba is happy at United, but he should have better players around him. Then there was Raiola talking shit about us and I think he just wanted to push our board to improve our squad. I think Paul has got a really good relationship with Ole since he remembers him from his old times at United. I know it's very popular for every magazine and website to talk about Paul leaving, since United right now don't have the ambitions player like Pogba should have, but I can't see him leaving this year.   \n\n\nTo further my point, Real can't afford him (since we don't want their deadwood, they wouldn't give us their youngsters and they seem to be going different way with going for young players. Also, they don't have enough money to buy him) and only other possible teams that could buy him are PSG and Juve. Juve has got enough of midfielders and while they would want him, I don't think they have the money. And PSG are PSG, they probably have the money but Pogba doesn't seem to be interested in playing for Uber league team.
You\u2019ve talked yourself into believing what you want to believe.  \n\nThe only way we will know for sure is if he signs a new contract.  IMO it\u2019s a bad idea to let a guy like Pogba enter the final 2 years of his contract.
I don't think that he will leave.
Raiola has clearly stated that Pogba wants to leave for a better club what makes you think he will stay with us?
Im a pretty big BVB fan and Hakimi wants to go back to real and real want him back so that will be a no go. Plus he is better than Williams tbh so why would we sign him primarily as a backup? If I was ed I would be looking at signing someone like Rousillion or Kurzawa on a free. Cant speak on Reguilon situation though.
Roussillon? Which Roussillon? I'm not sure if  Roussillon would be free in the end of season. \n\nMarcel Halstenberg, Sergio Escudero or Jonas Hector would be good. Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez would be good as a back up.
I know he does, that's why I immediately went to check the footage and it was proven once again that he does so. He does it really well, since the referees usually don't notice it since he is very quick to do so, but it's still against the rules. I think goalkeepers should be penalized for that or at least talked to, it's exactly the same as the wall moving closer to free kick taker.
They said before the season that VAR would not look at the keeper coming off his line on pens.
I think that that rule sucks, the taker already has an amazing advantage over the keeper.  A step to decrease the angle should never be punished
Swedish commentator said he has saved 4 out of 26 penalties he's faced in the PL
It is really strange that he can get away with that. I mean, everybody knows he does that, referees should watch him carefully for that. Or the rule should be completely removed if you don't get punished if you do it well.
Totally ruining MOTD for me!
Mate so true.
You underestimate my hand, good sir!
Necrophilia is a punishable crime, dear sir!
260 PL goals, no? He played in the Old First Division too I believe
Yeah that's what I thought - but he's definitely not the record holder if you include Old First Division...
Perhaps you\u2019re right. I just took the number from Wikipedia
Selling Shaw is a big no no. He's reliably above average all the time, case in point - the entire last season
Your average bar is very low then. I'd even keep young instead of Shaw.
Yeah. Every game I see him I see good runs and creative genius. He might not work against top6 because of lack of possession but the rest of the league he is fucking world class tbh
Juanfield <3
Good runs and good ideas. You are just not looking mate
What good run Mata barely runs
Because he's shown that he can't for most of this season.
Hes had plenty of games this season where he hasnt done the job this is literally his first good game this season
Think Rashfords was harder to miss tbh. At least for Williams the bounce and the angle were against him. Rashford just mistimed his.
Agreed, it was a wonderful pass and as you say it hasn\u2019t happened for a long time. I feel that the strikers often make these runs but the midfield don\u2019t see it as much.
the other great thing was both rashford and martials goals were in the 6 yard box. Good to see them both in the actual box to receive a cross.  \nPlenty of times this season we have seen the crosses come in and no one there!
It was something they did in training the day before and that says a lot
One that comes to mind is AP vs VIlla but that was quite a while ago
Lingard has just been bad. Mata has been mostly bad with the occasional good performance. If Mata played every game as well as he did today we'd be 3rd. They're both just so inconsistent, I don't think either are united quality.
you can't say because of one good game that Mata clearly isn't good enough. Hes slow, he has poor acceleration, agility and top speed. His passing and intelligence doesn't make up for it.
Didn't say that.
Oh I am sure they get the title. Just want them to lose one ASAP. Can't have them wining the title unbeaten.\n\nBut agree on the Spurs point.
We will end their unbeaten run next week\ud83d\ude09
We might as well beat them next week then
Awful tactics from Jose as well lul
Spurs have been hammering them the last 20 minutes now though, but they definitely miss Kane.  Lo Celso definitely should have pulled them even
No doubt. The New manager appeal is over.
Spot on. Theyve done fuck all since Poch's sacking lol. Zero noteable results
We're also managing an aging Mata well.
hopeful  about seeing more of Gomez in next few games
\u201cJa well the rain, you know, the rain was really slippery, and when it\u2019s hard to control the ball, you cannot win..!\u201d
Just re-watching the goals now. How he was in that position for Rashford to play him in I will never know but it was a brilliant bit of play between them and intelligent from Williams.
Ah, the City approach. Please Ed, sign a Belgian cycling doctor this january
Give him a role as a club ambassador. Just travelling around speaking about United in a positive way. Visiting schools and hospitals etc. Perfect job for him and easy PR for United.
Although I do not doubt that that is a role he could play very easily, I want him to be involved on the technical side, on the training ground with the youth and even the U23s.
Not just his vision,  his movement is some of the best in the team.  He's always running into space,  he's always there when someone needs an outlet
He\u2019s not gonna roast management to the press. Let\u2019s be honest
That man knows how to talk.
In fact, such positive reinforcement might prompt Ed to give him a midfielder like Bruno.\n\nSlagging him like Mou did certainly didn\u2019t work.
And we won
Or maybe us winning was down to the collective effort of the team and when we loose its down to the collective effort of the team ??
Right. That\u2019s why I have no issues with him missing that chance. We\u2019ve seen rashford do it several times this season already and it\u2019s not like Shaw would have even been there for that chance. He\u2019ll bang in the next one.
Part of me wanted the goal so much so he already doubled Shaws career scoring output
Young, too. His mistakes are forgivable, but I do hope his decision-making moving forward becomes better.
Spent regrettably long figuring out what Ashley had to do with this haha
MANEY TEAM\n\nMANEY MANEY MANEY MANEY MAAAAANEY
Don't forget MAson
As we were 3 goals up. I laughed out loud at that attempt. Dude will not be sleeping tonight :D \n\nHe was awesome today though. Still. I see some banter from the team at Williams.
He's young, he'll learn...
Yep would have been a nice highlight on a great performance.
A bit odd seeing how we desperately need a number 10.\n\nIf only either Mata or Gomes somehow fit in, they both can do it but weirdly don\u2019t.
I personally woult Matic leave, he is playing now(and he is doing OK) but because Mctom and Fred and injured and even Garner has been injured. It's true that we need midfielders and if he leaves we should sign another one more so if he keeps playing like that I can see staying more 1-2 more years but the ideal situation would be leave him and sign a replacemente.\n\nAnd yes Gomes could have an assist today, I have high hopes on him and I'm really happy he is playing again, hope he renews the contract now he seems to be a first team choice again
>I personally woult Matic leave,   \n\nSorry, my baf, should have clearer. We can trigger an extension in his contract for another year.
Yep! I didn't even think Andreas was bad today, but he wasn't \"good.\" He was average. Didn't make any mistakes but didn't really offer much either. Bruno would be a massive upgrade.
Andreas has at least had a decent string of games now. I think he would make a decent rotational option. Much better than Lingard at least
Ole is going to do a Fergie here.
I really want that to happen
Is it too soon for me to call Olebabes ?
I really hope so!
And we can clearly see that he is going the right way. Coming off the bench, score, and repeat.
You wouldn't Bruno can play at CM but he's predominantly a 10, so it would be Pereira or Mata (or *shudder* Lingard) making way from the starting 11 on any given matchday
Nothing wrong with playing two 8s instead of a 10 though. (God these fifa terms are so obnoxious)
Extremely so, Mctominay is good however I rank Matic a level above him as a DM who dictates our defence.
Who?
Rio mentioned that his legs didn\u2019t have much left towards the last couple of years at the club. SAF used to play him sparingly but to good effect. Then Moyes played him in back to back games week after week and his performance dropped off, resulting in him getting shipped out. \n\nMatic is in the same boat right now.
Hes played every game since the newcastle game no? The one attempt at resting him he played 45 anyway. The issue isnt so much fitness, as much as the speed and intensity of the games hes in. There will be some high intensity games where he simply cant keep up, i have a feeling that the liverpool game is one such instance.
We'll buy Maddison for 100 million, Leicester will buy Cantwell for peanuts, and somehow in two years Cantwell will be better. Of course, if we buy him he'll burn out and flop.
Van Dijk loves doing that as well tbf.
Exactly, so many good things
People expect immediate change when that\u2019s not what a rebuild is. A rebuild can take up to 3-4 years if you do it properly. Unfortunately what these people don\u2019t understand is that we have done none of it properly since fergi left. Like you said people just need to have more patience.
Np, I hope it'd his last game to wave goodbye, recent report their president(whoever came) went back already, speculations:left hanging.. Hope it's done deal tho just waiting after game..
What makes you think that!?
I don't know man. I just doubt that competence of the people in charge of buying players.
Especially Mahrez. With Kante I understand why we missed out but we could've had Mahrez before City did and he probably would've been amazing for us
but can he play LW? (Woodward, probably)
Thanks for the info
Yes and no. If Lingard leaves he's basically in the same spot he is now, but he's starting to get game time now. Also, given Bruno's versatility Angel could still play at 10 with Bruno and Fred behind until everyone is fit.
But giving him gametime is dependent on him signing a contract, and currently we haven't given him a reason as to why he should sign.
Gomes is not helping himself much by not signing a contract. i think if he had a contract then ole would have been more up to giving him a chance but when he is unsure of the desire of the player to be here in the future then he rather give chances to the ones that are committed to the team.
It's a two way street, we only got to this mess because he only got two appearances last season despite Ole mentioning our youth every other conference last season. \n\nIt's too late now with Bruno coming in anyway.\nTime to move on.
Hahah fair shout, it just seemed like a reasonably serious chat
[deleted]
Yeah im takin the piss, it did look like he was talking a lot
Shhhhhh
Actually Fred is pretty good against the big teams.\n\nHe was top class against Spurs and City, also pretty good last year at PSG away.
totally
Yeah. He performed better than his average level today. I just hope he keeps it up for big games.
Created 3 chances, more than mata
Haha yeah. Rashford's first goal is a proper poacher's goal. But I'm sure you know that Rashford is more of a mix of strength (powerful shots), a bit of skill (not every dribble pans out for him; I wager that his dribbling skill is not as good as Martial), and pace. \n\nWe need someone who can consistently poach (like Aubameyang or our Chicharito/RvN).
Well...we have seen it time and time again that some players just don't perform as well as they did in their old league when they moved to PL. I'm not saying PL is superior or whatever. But from what I see in the highlights (yes, highlights only), he is probably going to struggle in PL (and might be a bit overrated). Trust me, I want everything in the world for Bruno or whoever ends up joining us to be successful. But if you read my comments about our team throughout the years, I've been very realistic (and pessimistic if you will interpret it that way).
That is always a risk, but we can't keep believing it could never work. I don't think there's a single top league in the past 5 years that we haven't bought a flop from. \n\nDoubt a player because of the league he comes from we might as well buy nobody.
Great, thanks :D
World class is WAY a bit much.\n\nHe played better against what is the worst team in the EPL. And he stilled got dribbled on twice in the game.\n\nOle plays Matic and Mata in games like this because he knows their experience will benefit them, despite being older and slower than the average EPL player.\n\nAnd right now we don't have much of anyone else to play in Matic's spot.\n\nHis statistical rating in the last few games is very average. Especially compared to how he played against Leicester earlier in the year. But he is NOT a Top 4 team starter in the EPL. \n\nYesterday he played better - he played WELL - (and scored easily his highest statistical rating) against what is the worst team in the EPL. That's really all it was.
I never seen him as a pure CDM, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s that defensive orientated compared to how good he is at carrying the ball forward and picking the right pass and moving. When he first joined Chelsea I remember him being all over a prime Yaya Toure and winning that box to box battle. I think his legs are gone a bit but yesterday he did look a lot more sharp than he has for a long time, hopefully he\u2019s over some injuries and can sustain it.
Hmm, I know City had taken their foot off the gas at 3-0, but he did well to steady the ship there, maybe he could do the same against Pool. Thing Ole needs to look at is all of the 50:50 balls against Spurs on Saturday. The Liverpool players got to them like they were possessed, so quick to react and absolutely busting a gut to make sure they won any loose balls and recycled it into attack.
Yeah it is, but I just can\u2019t be bothered with the irrational negativity that completely takes over
Of course, we didn't need him, but there was a lot of situations that would have been either a goal or a dangerous shot if there was someone with better decisions, that's why I immediately thought of Bruno. It just shows how well our team in general worked today. But yeah, I agree that Bruno is needed much more for mid table teams.
Financial reasons, Sporting are genuinely a bit of a mess. \n\nEven their fans are certain he's going, which says a lot.
He's removed Sporting from his insta bio if that's any indication
Yea but Tot can always snatch him
Aye, and he\u2019s signed a new contract since then too, doesn\u2019t add up
It wasn't an extension, it was just higher wages for not getting a move in the summer. Can you people stop going crazy just because there weren't any reliable sources during a matchday and now a sunday? Jesus christ.
But, hey, at least there's Neves.
The thread refers to Virgil at the \u201cDutch Phil Jones\u201d and sending him back to Celtic
oh my bad, fuck em both tho
Guilty
i love that
Thanks for the replies, great to see such a complete performance as well as Mata pulling some strings!
Not sure about Sancho happening,He would most likely prefer to go live in London !
Bruno+Grealish+Buendia can be payed off with the Pogba transfer fee!
I fancy Neves
I mean he\u2019s 27. Not that old
Allan is 29
Yeah, I'll have to take one for the team on sunday.
No, you will do it naturally
So did you watch the game against wolves?
You know what you gotta do, man.
Agreed that\u2019s why I\u2019m a little late to the party on him. His strengths are what we\u2019ve been missing though so he\u2019s becoming an important player for us.
MMMM
But his creativity, we're missing that in thos team, someone with Mata's vision and speed eould be immense
Bro I know what you're trying to say, but Mata's vision and *speed?* Mata is slow as a snail, what are you even trying to imply
Come on Jose!
Stone is Woodward's mouthpiece. I still don't think we're going to sign anyone this window and Woodward is feeding out this Bruno news to distract the fans
How do you distranct fans from transfer news with transfer news?
Makes sense
That would just make things worse - that will give the impression that we've failed to get *another* signing over the line under Woodward which is a big criticism fans have of him. \n\nAlthough... I could believe he's just stupid enough to think that dangling a carrot will make the fans like him even after he snatches it away.
That's been true since 2014.
Martial Blind Fellaini Mata all been key in our trophy wins
i get that, but it would be sweet though. rashford is easily our best forward right now.
And rightly so.  We need him and Martial in every match.  Happy to see them get subbed for some rest.
God I hope so
i meant the premier league as a whole, not just united.
Oh okay, I thought you meant just at United. I don't know the answer then, unfortunately, but he surely has to be up top. He might be not be the best one at that, after all City score a lot from time to time and they have got stacked bench, I could see either Aguero or Jesus being up there. I might try to look for the stats somewhere
He didn't? Thats a bummer
Because he was an import. Bellingham is 16 so there isn't a contract to pay out. \n\niirc we didn't get paid from West Ham when they signed Odubeko.
oh...
Yeah Mata too.\n\nThough his first assist shows the importance for a player that has good vision and passing
Honestly, any player with good vision and passing is necessary for any side to function. And our lack of it is one of the reasons why we've looked rather toothless throughout the season. But sadly, Mata isn't that player anymore. He still comes up with the goods when the game is as slow as it was today but looks a proper passenger when it gets stretched.
Absolutely. Love it.
But man oh man, those deadly crossing
I wonder if he could adapt his game like Giggs did when he got older. With his vision and intelligence he could be quite useful still!
that was away i think
Damn then west brom? The 5-5 game?
Cardiff was away though
That definitely seems possible. Been getting knackered in almost every game he's played. He seems physically okay but never know how its affecting him mentally.
Depends how you look at it. Grealish is a proven PL player and won't need any time to adapt
So was Sanchez...
Bruno is massive for our Europa League campaign, and hopefully Champions league soon
Yea why the fuck did u get downvoted? Your question is perfectly fine imo.
Haha idk. I was hoping for some insights and opinions but that was asking for too much from some
That's my feeling too. I guess I was trying to ask if they could play together or if they're a like for like player that would be competing for a spot.
70 odd million for rotation ?
No way on earth a relegated player costs that much.
He's still doing that against most teams now, since he's the only one in the Villa side capable of doing anything. You only need to watch how well he carries the ball forwards to see that he's natural at it. \n\nWe'd never be able to get him on a loan, the only way we're gonna get him is if they get relegated (which there's a good chance of) and then he'll likely pine to stay in the PL, and they'll need the money from dropping down a league. They'd never accept a loan for their best player
Agreed. He's been decent, but he needs to have better decision-making in defense and in transition.
Thought this as well especially in the first half, but this is probably because we have a makeshift midfield of Matic, Fred, and Pereira. We need someone better on the 10.
I mean, great result and performance today aside, not making tactical changes in game is bad a philosophy for a manager to have.
Apologies, I don't think I explained myself that well. Its that he doesn't feel the need to have a Klopp style of management where he is on the sideline yelling instructions at all the players.
Not challenging this too much but have you got a quote for this? Pretty big thing for a manager to say TBH
I can't find the quote tbh so feel free to take what I said with a grain of salt.
Would be brilliant, especially with that bare bone midfield we have. Would rather Spurs make them look a bit more human by giving them the first loss first though.

The club hierarchy doesn't care about us.
It was a game in the league, not a league cup game. Not meaningless at all
A decent few days to recover so I\u2019d imagine we\u2019ve got it.
It's on Wednesday
It's not about being a downer it's about people realising the problem we are in isn't sorted by beating Norwich. And hyping players performances and being shit on those that didn't play this game means nothing on the whole and enough of one game deciding people's opinions whether a player is good or bad and if they are worthy of playing more games.\n\nEvery result needs to be taken in context Norwich are a poor side and don't just sit back allowing us to take advantage of how poor they are.
I didn\u2019t want to sound negative but I had to put it out there. It\u2019s alright if people disagree. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s his best offensive game. He\u2019s still young and there is a long way to go, no worries at all
We can agree that he is improving then I hope.\nI would have taken him for hes amazing defensive ability. Everything else is a bonus.
knee jerk negativity, sure! Knee Jerk positivity is always what happens on this sub and then people go the other extreme abusing the players and manager
