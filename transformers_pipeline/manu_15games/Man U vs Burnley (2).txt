This is not a one off bad performance, we have had multiple games like this, this season.\n\nOur rivals continue to drop points and we then proceed to shit the bed.\n\n3 of our best players have long term injuries, and all we have done so far in this transfer window is weaken our squad....
We can not break down defences. It's actually insane how bad we are at it. AWB must have been exhausted from his throw in and crossing exercises. The right side of that pitch had more action on it than Katie Price on a night out in Ibiza.
Our culture is reboot. Why so negative?
Fuck that was probably the worst timing for a post like that haha
5 year with minimal gain ismt doing alright to be honest
And they say people can't support a financial group.
Sad but true
It isn\u2019t, it\u2019s on a downward trend overall despite short term upticks.
Rotation decisions? I agree maybe Greenwood should\u2019ve started but otherwise who? Rotate who with who?
It's about which game/ competition to use which players. He cared too much about Carabao and FA cup, which led to the problems today.
Why rotate when you can play Jones and lingers instead.
Use heavily rotated squads for both Carabao and FA cups! Literally no one cares about Carabao cup.\n\nWe need to prioritize - Ole knows better than anyone how thin our squad is.
Everyone is to blame to be fair but mainly the board and Ed Woodward. OLE can't rotate what we don't have but now it's finally catching up to us.
Ole cared too much about Carabao cup/ FA cup which I can't get behind. He gives out strongest teams for every game & competition.
>Ole is also part of the problem for extremely poor rotation decisions leading to fatigues and injuries.\n\nHe's a bigger problem than that. This guy is a managerial shambles. There's not one Prem or Championship club that would take him over their current manager. And we've actually got fans still backing him!\n\nYes Ole thank you for sticking your leg out 21 years ago but you're shit please fuck off.
This comment makes me sad.
He'd at least win a couple of headers against Mee and the likes.
80 mins, my phone battery down to 25%. I decided to save what little power I have
This is the defeatist attitude of the modern Man Utd fan. Ole is shit, so are the owners. You can't just excuse how badly we play every week because we don't sign anyone. Sean Dyche has come with a gameplan and done us over because he knows how to manage a team. Ole is clueless and there is no fucking way any decent manager would lose 2-0 to that Burnley side if they knew what tactics were. Fuck the Glazers but i'm not going to excuse the fact that OLE IS SHIT.\n\nEdit: Also, Ole is a yes man and he has shown himself as a fucking yes man when he backs down every press conference when asked a difficult question. He will enable Woodward and we will get worse.
I completely agree. Managing isn't just about receiving new signings and selecting the team. Any random off the street could do that\n\nIts also about coaching and tactics. We are the literal worst team in the league in defending set pieces, *after* signing 2 defenders for 130m and breaking the record for a CB
Spot on. People want one nice easy thing to blame whether that\u2019s Ole, Ed or the players, realistically it\u2019s a mix of all of them. Just cause Ed is an idiot doesn\u2019t mean Ole\u2019s been good enough
Thank you. \n\nSoton is playing well in at least a few game. Leicester have built an amazing team outta nothing with one season of Rodgers. \n\nAnd we are still plodding along doing zilch.
Bang on mate. Hopefully more people start to understand this
\"no fucking way any decent manager would lose 2-0 to that Burnley side\"\n\nThis is not me defending Ole at all as I agree with the sentiment...but haven't our last 3 managers, all of whom were at minimum \"decent\" managers, lost these types of games over and over again? Moyes, LVG and Mourinho all had trouble winning games like this to varying degrees. Why?\n\nSacking the manager seems to be tackling the symptom rather than the problem. I don't know what the answer is but a new manager doesn't ever seem to solve anything.
That\u2019s what managers do.  SAF was also a bowing and scraping apologist for the Glazers (and still is to this day), Poch would be the same.  The alternative is throwing toys out the pram like Conte and Mourinho - it doesn\u2019t work.
But the right signings are not available.\n\n/s
[deleted]
So by that means there's a chance of 2 signings in next 4 years? Fk
Think we need more than one personally.
Ed Woodward:\n\n\"One it is!\"
I remember a certain Norway born manager sold our players because youth was enough.\n\nMeanwhile, Lukaku is having fun in Italy.
I would say most Man U fans believed Lukaku should\u2019ve been gone from the team. I\u2019m in that camp too. But I\u2019m also in the camp that believes he should\u2019ve been replaced in the same window.
Could bring on one of our best crossers of the ball for someone who was knackered by the 6th min.
And bring on whom.\n\nThis squad (after injuries and all) isn't good enough for top 4.
Not in the mood to argue mate. Just absolutely fucked off. If you think Ole has an excuse for barely registering a decent shot at home against Burnley then fair fucks. \n\nI just don\u2019t agree and you\u2019ll not convince me his strategy almost worked there. There\u2019s always an excuse for what he\u2019s done. I don\u2019t care anymore.
- the best he can\n- what he has\n\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t believe either are good enough.
> Ole is doing\n\nnothing.\n\nEvery team with shit players are beating us.
That\u2019s what playing 3 matches a week while also injured looks like
Maguire won almost every header he competed for, Jones was good but was being bullied by their strikers in the air
We've just worn him down to our level lol
Do you honestly think Maguire is a PL winning CB? A leader? The backbone of a new United era? \n\nThat\u2019s what he was brought into be, at the moment he is none of those things and it\u2019s sad people just won\u2019t face it, probably it would seem even sadder to have spent 80m on a flop. \n\nHis performance today was not only lacking in quality, but as a captain he was just not there, no passion, no anger, just another player with his head hanging down.
If Cahill, Stones, Otamendi, Huth and Lescott were PL winning CBs, Maguire can be too. The way he was rushed in back from injury to play every 90 minutes is telling, I wouldn't be surprised at all if he's still playing with painkillers.
Super reactionary take. No way he's worse of a signing than Falcao, di Maria, Memphis, Mkhitaryan, Bailly, Rojo, etc
They didnt cost \u00a385m
Glad one of our players has injured himself? Off you fuck. Bloody plastics
Jones not being able to play>>>>>> possibility of jones playing
the only reason Ole is still at the wheel is becasue ex United player , now pundits back him , \n\nThe Chairman just dont want to invest
Half that euro league squad isnt even here anymore and alot of that squad was brought in by lvg.
Well, no. He won the Europa League with Zlatan, Pogba, Valencia, Smalling, Rojo, Herrera, Fellaini, etc. Those guys aren\u2019t playing for us right now.
Mkhitaryan was really good in that run too
Given how thin the squad is and still will be next season I\u2019m not so sure that would be a bad thing
Tonight may be but I spent the past seven years far away from Manchester \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nEdit: last seven years are on EW

Maybe wait until you get your PhD
Defer a few years
Then travel the world, visit every country.
Haha. Same here man. I\u2019ve been dying to go watch a game live and not having to wake up early morning on a Saturday or a Sunday to watch a game. But at this rate, I\u2019d rather sleep it off than to fly across the Atlantic to watch this shit
I was actually thinking this today. I live in the US and have been dying to go with my gf to the point that we almost bought the flights a couple weeks ago. I told her we should hold off because I honestly don\u2019t see myself paying thousands of dollars and enjoying the experience if theres even a small chance we play like this. Total bummer
The first time there has been a positive to failing your exams.
At least we scored then...
It wasn't even as half as pathetic
I meant more the 'wait your whole life to save up and travel across the world to watch your favourite team play at home, and they lose pathetically in a game they're supposed to win'
Yeah, you\u2019re probably right. I don\u2019t know why. Poor sir alex is going to pass away with the club in shambles. Poor guy.
I could never see SAF doing it in public. He may be voicing his opinion internally but we have no idea what his influence is now.
Not much influence probably. But if he came out and said that he supports the fans, that would just be a massive pile on. \n\nHowever, I am sure as he left, they gave him a good package and another NDA so he can't say anything ever.
The Glazers don\u2019t care, we turn a hearty profit and they are wringing us dry and burying us into the fucking ground.\n\nThey boil my piss.
Its fucked up how heartless they are. Like if I bought something, like a car for example, and I\u2019m using it to Uber. I\u2019ll take care of my car like its the most precious thing. I\u2019ll change the oil when I need to. I\u2019ll buy new tires when I see that the current ones are showing some wear and tear. I\u2019ll make sure the seats are in good condition and that it smells good especially for the customers. Doing all that and making money using it I mean do they care about the club? In the state that its in? Do they know that we are currently the laughing stock of the premier league?? Its just embarrassing and Rio couldnt have said it any better
Herrera? And of course people will criticize bad performances, doesn\u2019t mean you get rid of them without replacing them.
Of course they\u2019re not superstars. \n\nBut you can\u2019t tell me selling your top goal scorer, a decent CM in Hererra and someone who offers a different tactic in Fellaini isn\u2019t going to impact squad depth.\n\nWe are threadbare, in quality, tactics and numbers.
Sometimes I feel like Ole is just quick selling everyone on Ultimate team for 200 coins. Embarrassing how a premier leagus club is run like this
Smalling wanted to start every match, nothing Ole could do about it
This guy maths
6th? Please, we are 4 points off 14th...
tbh anything could happen this year. this season has been wildly, wildly unpredictable as far as results. Only City, Liverpool, and Norwich have cemented their places lol.
This reality is so fucked.
And 6 off 4th
That's unbelievable but true. The league is just bizarre this year.   Everybody club outside Liverpool are either massively overperforming or underperforming.
Rancid performances against bottom half teams was the preserve of away games, now its seeping into Old Trafford - wouldnt be so sure
I've been saying since October United are on course for a 9th to 12th place finish this season\n I am sticking with that.
And funny thing is all it took was a couple decent signings and a good manager to get the most out of his players. It's not like Klopp broke the bank with this team. Klopp said when he left Dortmund he wanted a project. Liverpool was a massive project but he's built them into a dynasty. \n\nIs interesting comparing what United have done vs Liverpool during the Klopp era
Yeah but it took 30 years mate so it's not as simple as oh yeah they just got a good mananger and then good signings otherwise everyone would do it wouldn't they
I just don\u2019t understand how anyone thinks that our weak ass shallow squad would survive Poch\u2019s system... our squad can\u2019t stay healthy or rested and these people want to bring in arguably the most grueling system the Prem has seen in recent years... pure ridiculousness.
You must be deluded if you think sabotaging the team for a \"long-term vision\" makes any sense
Outgoings:\n\nLukaku\nShort term bad: because we didn\u2019t replace him. \n\nLong term good: didn\u2019t want to be here, likely to be a negative influence on other team members because of this.\n\nHerrera:\nShort term bad: didn\u2019t replace him. \n\nLong term good: wanted \u00a3300k wages or whatever for 5 years when he\u2019s already about to hit 30. Not a good deal.\n\nSanchez:\nShort term bad: well none really, all wanted him gone and off the wage bill\n\nLong term good: again, none really, we need him off the wage bill.\n\nSmalling\n\nShort term bad: now we see him playing well again, we need him back\n\nLong term good: now he\u2019s been away, he\u2019s found form again, he\u2019d be great right now but he needed to get away to find that form. I wish Jones could do the same.\n\nIn:\n\nMaguire:\n\nShort term bad: not started as well as he should. Not looking like the player we bought.\n\nLong term good: should be a long term captain of this club if he starts performing. Good age for the role.\n\nJames:\n\nShort term bad: asked him to step up to the prem and outperform others. He started well but has been unable to keep that up. Thrown in the deep end.\n\nLong term good:\n\nYoung, type of player we want at this club. Just needed more time.\n\nAWB\n\nShort term bad: none, been great. Need to develop his attacking contributions \n\nLong term good: he\u2019ll grow into the attacking game and become a monster.
Long term based on what? Our current transfer trajectory has us with no squad left in the long term..
See post below
This game has shown that greenwood is not a winger, if he plays centrally he has better chance if impacting the game, like most of the goals he's scored centrally and outside the box
Yeah I was right near the front but expected it to be dead. But was great to see them stand up and chant stand up if you hate glazers although some just stood and clapped confused but better than nothing lol.\n\nStretford end is the dream, a mates moving abroad so might be giving it to me next season. Let's bloody hope we have some of our shit together by then
Oh I agree man, I don\u2019t expect any changes above Ole at all. My point was it\u2019s irritating listening to the ex-players trying to show us \u2018look I\u2019m angry too\u2019 when they are shit scared of naming Ed and the Glazers outright as the main culprits in this situation.
*Pret-A-Manager becomes the official United brunch sponsor*
That would be a massive coop for Ed and our team, hopefully it happens. Who needs Bruno or anyone with legs when you have some good sandwiches to eat.
Do you go to watch FC United play?
Bruh the stadium I've never seen so empty on the telly before.
Only because it\u2019s a Tuesday, weekends it\u2019ll be packed again
Was a really late kick off on a week night
The problem is that\u2019s maybe 25% of the investment the squad needs.
Lingard and Periera won't improve. They are limited players. Lingard is known for his movement and work rate, yet he plays as a number 10 and cant control the ball, has no eye for a pass to unlock defences and is only decent in a counter attacking system. He doesn't belong in a team that aims for top 4. He scored one goal in the europa league. A whole year and that is what he has given us? It's a joke. Greenwood deserves to get starts the same way Williams has earned his starts, especially when Mata is forced to play on the right because our manager would rather play Pereira. I get that we dont have squad depth and we have a lot of deadwood but that is no excuse for playing bad players and not giving young, hungry and apparently fearless players a chance.
Couldn\u2019t have said it better myself.
Called the recruitment shit. Then said results prove Ole not doing a good job.
He won't be champions league contenders all of a sudden but at least it will be a big step towards rebuilding
At least get it right if you're going to bring his achievements as manager into the picture. He won two league titles and a domestic cup with Molde.
Idk man, its like I'm watching Robben the past few games, when the season started he was actually very unpredictable
I agree with you. He is left footed. I've just seen him use his right well enough to know how good it is but he's definitely left footed and has been favouring it a lot recently
It's fucking sad man. It really is. You're not wrong.
We've become the new mid-table team.
Exactly. Pointless wasting our time with all this Woodward needs to go bollocks. You really think the man that brings in big money that lines their pockets is going to get sacked? Not a chance.
I would\u2019ve agree with you a few months ago but it\u2019s become more clear recently that Ole and the board aren\u2019t seeing eye to eye
Ole is a yes man.\n\nSeeing eye to eye? As if Ole has every been anything but a puppet.
We\u2019re without 3 of our best players and the board aren\u2019t making any signings. Ole may not be the man for the job but nobody really is. With ownership like we have, there\u2019s just no way to succeed regardless of who the manager is. \n\nJose was right, he pulled off the impossible by finishing 2nd with us
Agree. But what a lot of fans don\u2019t realize is that Ole is a symptom of the clubs ills. No competent board would have hired him and allowed our standards to drop this much. Hence I want all of this BS fixed - fire Woodward or get a DOF in, and then clean out the roster with both the manager and deadwood players we have!
Milan with money *for now.\n\nOnce the results dry up - as they continue to do - do you really think top-tier sponsors will be tripping over each other to throw money at the club?
Yes, because sponsors don't care about results, they care about brand recognition and visibility. Manchester United is one of the most supported clubs in the whole world, which is a huge asset much more important for sponsors than results. Liverpool had basically no results bar a CL win for for decades before Klopp came along, and they had zero trouble getting sponsorships.
We've had 4 managers perform poorly at our club since fergie left. This isn't down entirely to management on the field.
Of course it is not. The chimpanzee at the top is what its all about, sadly. But he staying and we can do fuck all about it. Thats the facts here. So our options is very limited tbh.
You're essentially saying \"if the best manager in world football ever\"..... Bit of an unfair comparison even to the likes of Klopp and Guardiola, let alone Solskjaer who is still learning the trade.
Still learning the trade 10 years into his management career lol
He\u2019s been a manager for years. He\u2019s just shit at it.
You're delusional if you think SAF could've stepped in today and steamrolled Burnley with this XI. I'm not advocating for Ole being a great manager but I don't see what he could have done differently.
??????????\n\nIf SAF had that team at his disposal we would easily beat Burnley. Listen to yourselves ffs. If SAF had DDG, AWB, Martial, Maguire, Jones (a player who he brought in), Williams, Dan James and Mata he'd make this an easy 2-0 win. He's had worse players and beaten better clubs.
SAF definitely could have done that
What are you smoking? Did you see the squad SAF last won the league with?
https://www.balls.ie/football/man-united-vs-arsenal-fa-cup-2011-360756
I simply can\u2019t comprehend the fact people actually defend him. Structure is one thing but to me ole being manager is the most egregious thing Ed and the board has done
Same with Lampard who has come in and shown to be flexible and play with an actual game plan.
We still can't defend set pieces
He has stepped up for a part of the season
Yep also Martial will be one injury away and Greenwood will be run to the ground soon.
AWB looks exhausted as well, may need to call Irwin or one of the Neville brothers.
Fucking hell, looking like a proper team alright
[removed]
So we were shit coached by LVG and Jose as well? These problems have been around for multiple managers. What is the common denominator?
After today, I really should've. Had a damn stressful day.
Lol like I was making a threat. Gtfo
Actually I didn\u2019t scroll the thread. I pretty much knew what was going to be discussed so I just opened it, wrote my comment, and closed it :-)
ah f, so i am the only one who scroll to bottom this thread to find something good? stats looks good, so i think ones will appreciated it, but turn out it seems stats didn't tell the match correctly.  \n\ni missed this match, and now i am not regret it.
Yeah this season has been terrible, 5th and 14th are only  5 points apart
Not true, here is the average points per position since PL began v this year.\n\n Avg 1995-18/19 | Current 19/20  \n1) 51 | 61  \n2) 45 | 48  \n3) 43 | 45  \n4) 40 | 39  \n5) 38 | 34  \n6) 36 | 34
You'd only include an average that includes results from the 90s to deliberately skew your numbers using a time when \\~80 pretty much guaranteed you the title.\n\nHow about we look at the most recent years in the PL, and see what 40 points (4th place) and 34 points (5th) would put you after GW 24 (assuming better GD in case of ties):\n\n2018/19: 7th, 9th\n\n2017/18: 7th, 8th\n\n2016/17: 7th, 9th\n\n2015/16: 5th, 8th\n\n2014/15: 7th, 10th\n\n2013/14: 7th, 11th\n\n2012/13: 6th, 9th\n\n2011/12: 7th, 10th\n\n2010/11: 7th, 10th\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis season the 3 best teams are still very good, but the rest of the league is mired in mediocrity including 4 of the 'big 6', and a couple of small clubs (wolves, sheffield) have real shots at EL spots in their place.
Yes and no. There\u2019s lots at play here. Not just, oh we\u2019re struggling and still 5th therefore leagues shit. \n\nIt\u2019s more complicated than that.
I didnt say that at all, i said the whole league is struggling this year outside the top 3.  Chelsea\u2019s 40 points would have them in 7th place last season at this point, 5 points off of 6th.\n\nInstead they are in 4th, 6 points clear of 5th.  Outside liverpool and city, the rest of the \u2018top 6\u2019 are historically bad (for them) this year collectively.  Taking solace in being 5th in this league is trash, and oh yeah, we are 30 points off first.  Thats pathetic, hands down
Well, Liverpool are basically getting a free run right now. IMo they even looked a lot more dominant last season than this one, they've gotten their fair share of average performance and clutch wins. On top of that, Spurs and Arsenal, both, sacked their own managers this very season, City lost their best defender (Laporte) with an injury while one of their key players (Fernandinho) is starting to decline. Chelsea are off from losing their best player, they lost their world class manager and brought in a legit rookie to replace him and were banned from signing anyone in the summer. Their January signing they made to kinda cope with Hazard leaving has been injured for a while too. Only Leicester City have been able to keep up with some sort of consistency and they finished beneath midtable last season. It's just been a bad season for the top 4 race all around.
> All of this is true and can all be true at the same time.\n\nA concept good chunk of our fans just can't seem to comprehend.
The *cultural reboot* thread worked as this sub in a nutshell, though. Some positivity, although plenty didn't agree with his overall point, I certainty didn't. Then comes another loss and the inevitable reactions. Went from having a good amount of upvotes to getting locked within minutes of the final whistle.\n\nIn terms of what u/justalostcoder mentioned in terms of discussing tactics and philosophy; that's something people on this sub has done through all of this. It's no coincidence that nearly every commentator and expert, across nearly all our matches, on different networks, keep bringing up the topic of our lack of movement and creativity when we're not on the counter. It's been every match and it's been discussed, from what I've seen and participated in, in some detail in most post-match threads and the like. \n\nAs fans, we've got plenty of reasons to be negative based on everything that's going on with this club we hold so dear but how that negatively takes shape is important. The same goes for the positivity in this sub as well. After the Liverpool game, people lifted Fred into the sky, and well deserved for that performance. However, there's also people who suddenly come in and start pulling positivity out of thin air, like the Lingard hockey assist thread or the eventual xG threads which nearly became a meme. \n\nI'm rambling on a bit here but my main point is that this sub is far from perfect and going to stay that way as long as this continues. People are fed up and frustrated, and some people don't channel that in the best ways. That manifests itself in some people attacking others for the wrong reasons, people literally saying they're giving up the club etc. \n\nWhen it comes to counter attacking football, u/juurdd, the main issue is that we're currently a side that can often sit with 50-70% but with no effective system in combination with lackluster players in central roles, to break teams down. Plenty of our players run and move like crazy whenever they have 50 yards of space in front of them but are completely static when it comes to moving when play slows down and there's less space to attack. A result like today, as in many other matches, are both on Ole and the quality of the players. We're still not seeing enough development and progress in a lot of the areas where the problems has been nearly constant since the start of the season. When you don't have players you're willing to allow the freedom to do their shit, then you got to coach them. You got to tell them how and where to move in order to open space for other players, and all the rest. That's honestly where Ole, and in effect the rest of the coaching staff, looks completely out of touch.
Well written. Makes me feel bad for not putting in  much effort in my message formats.\n\nTo the discussion though, this sub is reactionary myself included at times but I think its getting to the stage of tipping point between this sub and what we have seen in the stands late in the game.\n\nI do believe Ole is out his depth and as you mentioned the coaching isn't there in terms of movement but why too did LVG and Mourinho fail to succeed. I think Ole is to part blame in this but the problem is higher up and that surely has to be clear at this point when we've gonr through so many managers and purchased marquee players.\n\nHowever, I'm assuming the glazers don't care provided money is coming in and we could all discuss this till the end of time but probably won't see much change other than a new manager by the end of the year.
I can actually see some merit to the cultural reboot post. But let's be honest Ole is not the only problem and he is also not the solution either
More like dreams and reality
Anyone still saying Ole has got the managerial ability to manage this club is an embarrassment.
Reads like a post from r/the_donald lmao
I don't believe OP wrote it. Same person whining yesterday about his shitposts getting removed, and then turns into Shakespeare
He's changed his flair to \"back the manager\" of course lmao
it's still up, wdym?
can you share a link? I can\u2019t find it
Leading to a general apathy towards the club which in turn will lead to a loss of value thus forcing the owners to sell.
Really? On paper our team is miles ahead of Burnley, and that's not even close
Burnley or no Burnley, large parts of our team is not good enough.
True, the pool is destined to have shit because of the parent's incompetence.\n\nHowever, the problem can be lessened by having a kid that can swim and a proper vacuum and sanitation system (good coaches)
Maybe draining the pool, which we are doing, _and then actually putting water back in it._
Youth\n\nCourage\n\nLose 2-0 to Burnley at home

Tweeted something very similar to this. The players not mentioned here, including Martial and Pogba, should be sold asap or in the following windows.
McGuire is ok but at 85 price tag i think it's just not worth it. But yes already here so what tha heck
The fact they let Smalling go out on loan but kept Jones as 3rd choice tells you all you need know about poor decisions.
Bro i have a uni exam tomorrow and sacked of the revision to watch whatever that was
Ahh man that's tough.\n\nI know this sub can be split/toxic, but one thing we all do is support our club to the fucking end, no matter what.\n\nBest of luck in your uni exam fella!
Even though they played like shite. Id prefer watching that over studying anyday of the week LOL
Can you give me the gist of it?
Someone posted a ten paragraph diatribe about how weve rebooted united culture. It was a load of wank but plastics upvoted it. Now it's gone thankfully. It was embarrassing.
https://imgur.com/t/roguelike/uPbkRSa
- Vision for the club\n\n- Ability to clear out dead wood\n\n- A decent recruitment record\n\n- Working relationship with club heirarchy\n\n- No one better than him would sign for us as a DOF because of Ed's unwillingness to relinquish power
The jury is still out on Dan James. Could be a great future player, could be a bench warmer we don't know yet.\n\nWan bissaka buy was a no-brainer, mourinho already wanted Maguire and Ole over-paid for him. He isn't worth 80 mill and we should have had more suitable replacement other than Maguire or bust.
Yourr right. But the set piece goals we constantly concede isn't about midfield cover. We are still terrible at defending set pieces. It's the same issue from last season. We binned smalling and bought Maguire yet its the same issue.
I agree with you on that one, we are absolutely terrible at set pieces, both offensively and defensively. It just makes me wonder who actually is our set piece coach, but based on how we struggle with them I suppose we don't have one. We should really change the way we defend set pieces (drop the zone defending and bring in man marking) and we should actually create something from ours, since I haven't seen us create anything from a set piece for a long time (not counting our short set pieces and subsequent crosses, I can only remember one corner when James played low pass to Scott who ran out of nowhere and he missed by a very little, I don't remember what match it was though)
Scott could also have more time to rest.\n\nOle is overusing players in the second-rate tournaments, when our squad is barely capable to produce an adequate starting eleven for the PL.
It's all about the silver linings
I am willing to do anything in reason, I'm at a gap in jobs for the next month and refuse to see us turn into Milan or worse. No one person anywhere is bigger than the club.
Is it worse than Losing 4-0 to MKDons though
I don\u2019t know why we pay so many wages to medical staff.
The players are having a bad season and want to prove to everyone they can do better. The managers having a bad season and needs his best players and so plays them even if they aren't 100%.\nThe club has sold our depth and so we can't rest half the team if we tried. We've failed on so many levels this season it's unreal. \n\nWe need a massive overhaul and the club needs to make an inquiry into why this situation has happened three or four times already this season. Rashford/Pogba/McTominay all on lengthy layoffs due to poor decision making by the club. I reckon Maguire will be the next one, I mean who do we have to take his place?
Ah great so we want to basically end careers of these players. \nWhat is the medical staff fucking doing?
He is playing throught a triple stress fracture a floating dildo in his ankle, half a brain missing in his head and an ACL injury no worries tho he'll get some rest when we have a big enough squad xo
Look man that Cardiff job, even SAF recommended him not to take it. It was set to fail from the beginning. I know Ole does not have enough experience to be incharge of this club, but he is definitely not part of the problem, and I'm not saying that inorder to protect him or anything, rather I would say he was not the correct solution. He had good intentions when he joined the club, got rid of some high wage players, introduced youngsters to the squad, and did his best with what he had. Again, I would say he was set to fail, just like his Cardiff job. Hence I'm not blaming him for this dire season and half under his spell.
Yeah, I get you. I have not anger towards Ole at all (except his management of injuries). It\u2019s not his fault in that sense. He was perfect for the interim role but he should never have been given the full time job. That\u2019s on Woodward, not him.
Tbf he didn't get any real chances. Mostly hopeful shots from outside the box
He was one on one with the keeper in the first half after the mata dummy.\n\n  \n\n\nWan bissaka also set him up with a tap in
I count 2 Clear Cut Chances, inside the Penalty Box.
A squad that needed a serious revamp even in the season it won that title. Fergie knew it but his hands were tied and signed RVP for one last title before leaving. Solskjaer will go down as one of our worst managers
RVP and Rooney were better than our front 4. Still had chitcharito, Evra, Carrick, Rio, DDG
That's the thing.\n\nWe don't have creative players to proof the team can't beat lesser teams.\n\nIf the team gets creative midfielders and same thing keeps going on, then it clearly be Ole's fault.\n\nBut we don't know because there's no Quality players in the midfield(until mctominay and pogba return).\n\nIMO
You don't need Bruno or Maddison to be creative. Obviously they'll take you up a level but you can still be creative without that kind of player. Look at how we move the ball, no intensity, no urgency, nothing. Whenever we get the ball in build up our players take a couple touches forward, see if they can find a pass and inevitably just recycle the ball back to where it came. You need to move the ball quickly, you get taught as a child to make the ball do the work, that the ball moves quicker than you, so if you can move it quickly it opens gaps in the opponents defensive shape for you to exploit. People need to scrap this mentality that we need Pogba or whoever to play delicate little balls to our forwards to be creative, for a lack of a better word it's the most uneducated approach to the game I've ever seen.\n\nNext time we play, watch how long it takes for us to move the ball from the left side of our field to the right side when we run into congestion, then go watch Liverpool, City hell go watch Brighton and how quickly they move the ball from side to side. It's a joke.
I disagree but I'll dwell there with you for a second. \n\nEven in that scenario, stop playing 4231, we don't have a 10 (creative midfielder). Adjust to the hand you've been dealt with the injuries, lack of signings, etc. But he hasn't, he's persisted with the same unsuccessful formation and tactics over and over. Good managers would make in game adjustments nevermind game to game adjustments.
You\u2019ve lost your head son
> Conte did it, and he wasn\u2019t even a Chelsea legend.\n\nAnd how did that help him? Or Chelsea?
He got a massive payout, then moved back to Italy where he continues to manage
The situation at Chelsea was no where near as dire as it is at United now. But anyway, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll help, but it\u2019d be decent to watch the board get shafted in the public domain.
It did prove one thing though, that Conte was right. He's working his magic with Inter with the board arguably backing him.\n\nAnd Chelsea have struggled under Lampard because of lack of signings too.
He won't, he is a coward
Yeah First half we weren't terrible, some nice little passages of play with absolutely no end product, just so wasteful with some really good chances, then the second half we weren't even in the game, absolutely shocking.
Lol this season was always going to be a write off, but for gawds sake are we bad at breaking teams down.
No rotation. If you have no quality on the bench you can either put out a weaker side of players or put out a tired side with better quality.
My point is more that we should be creating more than three chances at home.\n\nI'm also not sure Burnley play much differently at 1-0 down, until maybe the 75th minute when they'd open up.
We usually try avoid crossing and when he does it's desperately pulling back from the byline after going down the outside of his man. Here, we had structured attacks mained at freeing him up with men to aim at in the box for low crosses. It was much more calculated and considered all around, and was paying dividends until the team just kind of imploded.
I remember seeing him making a some crosses in previous games too, but here he was always available. You think that was the plan, to attack with crossing? It looked like it could work first half hour or so.
Yep.
You don\u2019t think Carlo can plot out a plan to beat this world class defence??
I just have a feeling about that game for whatever reason. \n\nMind you United could lose literally every one of those games and I wouldn't be suprised. Obv Carlo is league's above Ole tactically.\n\nOle will undoubtedly surprise everyone by trying to play counter-attacking football /s
Everyone bar McTominay, Herrera, Pogba and Lukaku but Ole still got 150m to spend in the summer.
James, Maguire, Wan-Bissaka, Greenwood, Williams, Pereira didn't start under Mourinho. It's not really the same team.
6.
Based on appearances from that season: De Gea (37), Matic (36), Lingard (33), Martial (30), Mata (28), Jones (23), and Shaw (11). All of those, except Martial and Shaw, was in the top 11 for minutes played, as well.
And he had Zlatan, Pogba, Herrera and Lukaku. Not exactly the same team. But I agree he overachieved.
What does that even mean?
Poch is capable of instilling a player style with bare minimum resources. \n\nHe also doesn\u2019t destroy his players health trying to chase 3 points against almighty Burnley
Instilling some type of attacking philosophy to break teams down is a start
With what creative players?\n\nOur most creative player is Mata ffs
How about not overplaying rash or replacing guys like lukaku and sanch
Ahh sorry I thought you meant this game!
Oh that too, really be careful of what you wish for because you might not be lucky enough to find a suitable replacement in your first try and could be stuck with another season and a half of misery like we did.
I'm okay with any manager tbh, just standing behind the one we've at present. I need to believe that he can deliver, otherwise it's just wasted potential on the field day in day out.
Do you really think Poch would want to come to this? He won\u2019t be promised anything, he\u2019s had enough of cunty chairman\u2019s with Levy not getting players when needed, Woodward is his worst nightmare. He\u2019ll wait out the PSG/Madrid job.
You\u2019re probably right. If the opportunity is there for him, they should go for it. If not, I guess with stick with Ole and see if people\u2019s blind faith is right.
You know what I had completely forgotten about AWB. He has rarely missed a game he has not rest and in some moments in this game I saw him tired and in pain. But dont worry, we have Ashley Young to play in his position. Oh wait...\n\n\nEdit- a word
Thankfully we have a recently returned non match fit Dalot to take over once he does get injured.
Lukaku, Depay, Di Maria, etc. They all fucking did it.\n\nI rate Martial, I really do. He needs service and a little confidence boost imo
Yeah I think service is what he's lacking. There's a very noticeable quality gap in our attacking players. When the ball gets fizzed into Martial he has excellent control, he turns well, all the hallmarks of a quality forward. I think he just finds himself so deep and out of position at times due to our complete lack of creativity. I attribute his poor finishing recently to lack of confidence.
God you're probably right. Not looking forward to pogba's mvkr for that reason.
Martial didn't fail to turn a good chance in to at least a shot on target against Liverpool, or fluff all his chances against Burnley, because of our poor set piece defence.
He can't be too short on cash. Reckon he's got those loaves stacked up
Just because something is long does not mean it is thoughtful
That's what happens when you don't have a midfield.
The thing is other teams like Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham are performing sub par causing less damage to United\u2019s position even after losses. Maybe seeing their qualification spot is also keeping Ole at the club. Plus with the current team injury list and poor chemistry I don\u2019t know if any new manager would be able to make a turn around. Post summer is very likely that they bring in a new manager.
Sad but true
Strange as to why MUTV review was cut short though.
Thank you. And yes, that's probably what's best right now.
Thank you so much!
I know, I\u2019m ashamed of myself
Nothing to be ashamed of lad, our club is gone for the time being and it\u2019s not our fault
he is a major problem though, he and the staff are not very good at their jobs either.\n\nActually maybe woodward, the board, and ole and staff are made for each other.
Culture rebuild nonsense. Ole isn't qualified to be a DOF, why do people keep suggesting this? It's loyalty to a legend is the only reason I can think of, it's sad it's not worked out for him, but he's simply not good enough, that doesn't mean he gets a new job he's not qualified for.
It is absolutely vital that someone in power sets the appropriate vision and tone for this club. The Glazers or Woodward will never be able to and that is the best argument for United having a Director of Football in the first place; someone in a position of power must keep the vision. And there is no option in the world better suited to do that for Manchester United than Solskjaer.
When we've had an actual midfield we've looked pretty decent this season. \n\nHe's cleared out a lot of deadwood and not been backed in the transfer market, what exactly do you want him to do?
Here we go. You mean at the start of the season when we lost to Palace, drew to 10 men Southampton, etc? Or last season when we got blasted 4-0 by a mediocre Everton side and lost to relegated Cardiff and Huddersfield in a month? In any scenario, the available squad we've had shouldn't be losing to the likes of Burnley at home, Newcastle, Palace, West Ham, etc. How can anyone defend this shit is beyond me. Ole would have never have gotten a job in any other premier league side in the first place and for a reason, let alone continue after 10 months or so of sackable form. He's not the only one to blame for this circus but only in this sub do you find people blindly defending the man, it's incredible.
Should have never been more than an interim.
the idiocy in giving Ole a full time contract and then negotiating DDG to a huge wage packet when no one out there was looking to sign him...bone head ED.
Bruh there's no point to sacking him now. Nobody in world football could come here and do anything with this team right now. We were a thin squad to begin the season and we've been destroyed by injuries to key players. Pep and Klopp would have a fucking aneurism looking at this team right now. Give Ole till the end of the season and then asses if we want to move on.
What if we do have the 100-200 million budget but Woodward and the board decided to keep it for the new manager rather than Ole?\n\nUnited isn't a lost cause. Many great managers would still love the challenge to bring United to the best again.\n\nOle is a good manager, but sadly he's just good, not going to be great.
This is the best course of action I can think of. No point in sacking him now and legit burning the whole thing into the ground.
Woodward and Glazers suck, but Ole can be bad at his job at the same time, and he is.  Ole's friend in media have given him a virtual free ride. I don't see any improvement in squad, no game plan. He really is un-mourinho in terms of his dealing with the board and players, thats all he is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"ok Lads, lets express ourselves\" can only take you so far.
You're right. These sentiments aren't healthy for a fan base. Apathy is not healthy for a fan base but people have become apathetic.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that the club I'm seeing right now is just broken all the way through and is no representation of anything that I've loved over the years. \n\nThe last few years have been mostly bad times but there were remnants/memories of things I liked. Even at the twilight of their careers and when their performances were sub-par, I still loved players like Rooney, Ferdinand, Giggs, Carrick because I felt like they were Manchester United through and through. they represented something bigger than themselves.\n\nI don't feel any of that with 90% of the players at the club now. What am I even supporting anymore? It's not the players. It's not the manager. It's not even a \"legacy\", because none of these players have a legacy at united. \n\nIn comparison, I look at a club that is in the same spot as United right now, Spurs. I enjoy watching players like Son, Kane, Alli, Lloris, even when they're not performing. I respect Mourinho, despite his antics off the pitch and despite his flaws on the pitch.\n\nI don't think I'm articulating my points properly, and it's a bit rant-y. I apologise. I'm trying to work it out myself, to be honest.
Yep.
why man why you gotta destroy the only bit of hope I've left. I feel so fucking terrible. What did we ever do to be in this state
Let SAF retire lol , I feel you man but we have to face the fact that we are no longer a top club
Nah we\u2019ll scrape a win vs tranmere rovers and some people will start talking about the \u2018process\u2019 again
Sorry to burst your bubble, but it\u2019s not like United had any creative bone in their bodies tonight. United shouldn\u2019t have been up by 2 or 3 ever. Their best chance was tipped over the bar by Pope, and then the rest were pea rollers or just blasted wide.
What, did you miss first half or parts of it? Mata missed a sitter, so did Martial. How Mata completely missed the ball and how martial need 4 touches to shoot when you are on 5m is beyond me.\n\nBut yeah, when they later get their 2 goals goals and sit low we have very little creativity.
Is there a difference at the moment?
They go hand in hand!
Said results prove Ole isn't doing a good job. Even with injuries he's not doing enough.
Don Rio ffs
You can have 100% possession and not have a good chance at goal. You need tactical prowess to be able to win matches.\n\nAgain, if this was Real Madrid, or any other club that has the same stature as us, would the manager really survive?
[deleted]
In an ideal world, I would like to see that deteriorating over time, so that they realise that the results on the pitch correlate directly to the bottom line.\n\nUnfortunately, I agree with you, there\u2019s too much money in this current setup. My only fear is that we\u2019re going to slip down the stature of clubs, exactly like the scourses did in the 90s, 00s and 10s
This is not FM. A sub is not the only way a manger can turn things around. The formation, patterns of play all can make a huge difference. Ole has none of that. His tactics are all about hoping that individuals create some magic and score goals.
Against Liverpool he adapted using a back 5 and neutralised taa and Robertson, their best attacking outlet. Against Burnley, he went 4-3-3 but because of lack of wingers he had two 10s instead of a right winger. I'm not saying he isn't at fault, but if martial and mata had hurried those 2 chances you wouldn't be doubting his competency. The bigger issue is recruitment and upper management.
Who had lost his dressing room, Ole's perofmrong like a manager who's lost his players then?
Well he has, to injuries. But it wasn't meant as much as a comment about Ole as pointing out the main problem lies elsewhere than the manager.
Then you should constantly carry that belief. Not sulk in the shadows when we have good results
There's no point coming out and shitting on the manager after a good result regardless of if you want him out, there's no meaningful discussion to be had.
How do you think it goes if I point out that beating the worst team in the league 4-0- means nothing?\n\nIt'll just get buried and hidden. Waste of effort.
Isn't that a point of having a manager to foresee that our squad is adequate enough to fight for the season? Ole and the upper management must have known that this squad is way too thin if an injury outbreak or a flurry red cards were too given to us. It all reeks of poor planning and if you can't plan how will you lead?
Even Jose Mourinho couldn\u2019t seem to do this so I\u2019m not getting my hopes up for Ole to suddenly figure it out
[deleted]
I can't believe people keep making excuses. Yeah, we weren't perfect under Jose, but he was still 11 points better off last season.
Jose isn\u2019t a good coach, he doesn\u2019t drill teams to break down low blocks, he drills teams to be resilient defensively and trusts his frontline to create chances from themselves, such a ridiculously poor example.
Set pieces , absolutely. Been ages since we scored from a corner and have a horrible record this season.\n\nWe had 4 clear cut chances in the 1st half that Martial and Mata scuffed. So he got on Greenwood who's more clinical. Don't see a problem with this sub tbh
To be fair, that left back was the only united player to put the ball in a net tonight.
Because all a manager does is put out a lineup? What happened to tactics or patterns of play or anything else a manager does? FFS you don\u2019t have to defend Ole to attack Woodward. You can blame both parties, with varying levels of blame for each.
I don\u2019t get this reasoning? Just because it\u2019s our strongest available line up doesn\u2019t mean you can pull the \u201cwhat\u2019s Ole meant to do?!\u201d card. The managers job is more than just putting 11 players on the pitch, he needs to be doing work on the training ground and sending them out with a game plan. He\u2019s getting at most 60% out of these players, that\u2019s the fucking issue..
Our players are collectively better than Burnleys and we were at home today, you should have picked up on that from all the red you saw from the empty seats as people left the stadium in disappointment.\n\nNo excuse for only winning 9 games in 24.
The fuck are you on about, Burnley team man for man isn't at all on the level of our fucking team but they cleaned us up. Same as Watford. \n\n130 mil on a defence and its shittier than last year, wouldnt give Ole any more cash if he's got no ideas no tactics no philosophy
[deleted]
And yet we still got completely outplayed with our \"superior\" squad
Look at the squads other managers in the league have. Sheffield United's squad consists of rejects and free transfers and they're doing almost as well as us.
Pochettino is one of the top 5 managers in the world. When Ole gets fired from here he won't get picked up by a relegation threatened team. Yes, the squad and board suck, our manager isn't up to par either.
Mate, it's not how you line up, it's how you play. We are AWFUL. We play static football. \n\nThe problem is everyone talking about buying new players, we can't just buy a new team and expect to be world class with Ole in charge.
You cant put those players on the pitch and say \"play like Barca\". Theres no capability in the middle of the park. No quality.
You tell me which player in our team is going to unlock defences like Burnley who don't come for a win set up with a sea of punching bags in front of our attackers.
We literally have no options. Our squad needs so much of investment.
There is always an option when you are choosing between Pereira and literally anyone else.
We've been getting routinely beaten by dross for almost a year, Ole is massively at fault. Do you really think our squad is just 4 points better than Newcastle, Burnley and Palace? Obviously Woodward and the owners should be held accountable for the shit recruitment policies but equally obvious is the fact that Ole hasn't got a clue.
> Do you really think our squad is just 4 points better than Newcastle, Burnley and Palace? \n\nI think our first team is, yes - when you take out Rashford, McTominay and Pogba. I mean, we've played virtually the entire season without our best player, and while the squad should do better, there isn't any depth and players are shattered.
And who do you want him to bring in instead?
Angel Gomes was still on the bench, not that he'd likely bring anything more to the table, but still a better option. Also how have we become better on the pitch in any way under Oles management? Sure the board is a bunch of clueless morons but that does not mean that Ole is a manager worth anything, by far the worst manager in the Prem.
He has asked for signings multiple times.
Sure he did ask but every time transfer negotiation fails he would steer it as if it was part of the plan. He is allowing Ed Woodward incompetency
So you want to bench our only \"senior\" goalscorer for an 18 year old? \n\nReally?
Are you Alan Hansen? What does being senior have to do with anything at United. If you\u2019re good enough, you\u2019re old enough. Mason is clinical. \n\nWe need to mix things up, the current recipe isn\u2019t working and the results prove that.
Perhaps. We have the highest wage bill in the league I believe... Is it worth it?
No it's not. We should be expecting better. A problem with executive ownership is that when the failing is on their part, there is no one to hold them accountable.
James was worse tbf
Pereira was trying. He had a better first half than Daniel James for instance. His subbing off was harsh. Greenwood looked lost out there, completely, I don't even blame the kid
Pereira always tries. It's just not enough. He has one quality moment per game and the rest is awful. Daniel James has been bad for a few games. He needs a break. I think Ole bringing on Greenwood to constantly save games is a bit of a joke. I get not wanting to put pressure on him but its worse for the boy to have to come on 1-0 or 2-0 down than what it would to start him. Playing Mata out of position when Greenwood could have played there is insane. I think the players are poorly coached anyway. I think that if it's one or two players being bad, it's a personnel issue. If it's the whole teams performance constantly being bad, it's a coaching issue. Cause the way I see it, if we get Bruno Fernandes in tomorrow, the style of play wont change. We will just have another player who can produce moments to paper over cracks.
Looked at our most dangerous with him on though. And came close to scoring too
And yet we saw the same group do the same shit under LVG and Jose, two proven world class managers. Let's get another one in to see them fail as well, maybe then people will realise the manager is probably 5% of the problem right now.\n\nThe club is rotten all the way from the top, that includes players not giving a shit.
Ole is doing even worse than Jose and LVG. Yes, the club is rotten top to bottom and that\u2019s not changing. The only hope we have is a more competent manager.
New manager every second season is the new strategy
Exactly, even Sir Alex wouldn't be able to win matches with bloody carrots on the pitch instead of players.\n\nWoodward needs to step off, Glazers need to change or gtfo as well.
He should, there\u2019s a lack of experience in that dept imo. The lack of identity to our play suggests that\u2019s one area he needs help. \n\nBut really if we could start with removing the virus that is Ed Woodward that would help.
I have been thinking about why ole brought rashy on in that fa cup tie, I think he wants to win the fa cup more than anything now this season so he can say it was somewhat successful of a season to the board with a straight face. Ugh.
got it! who do you guys think that should do with the actual team and board?
The board, we can only protest and hope that they listen.  Do what we did today. Anti Glazer chants and preferably a manager that can put some pressure on them in public like Pochettino did with Levy this summer. Or as Mourinho did this summer too. Pressure about signings and When they dont come people Will see that if a manager is asking for deals to be done and they arent; focus and critique is shifted to the board. \n\nUnfortunately our current hero OGS has 3 times stepped to the defend the board on pressconferences so his head should roll first followed by Ed and Glazers.
I think you'll get mixed answers. The thing is, all of us know the board is incompetent, our club owners don't care about the club and there aren't any people in the higher management who actually understand football (Woodward being the prime example). As long as the board management stay the same, nothing will change in this club and no manager will be successful here. That's something everyone mostly agrees with. On the other hand, Ole splits the fan base a bit, because some people want to change our board AND manager (their arguments - Ole isn't good enough and we should go for Pochettino/Allegri while we can) and some people want to change our board and give Ole a proper chance with full support of the board (argument - he has had a very positive impact on the youth and rebuild of our academy, he has played quite a lot of youngsters so far, our younger players are/were having the best season of their lives - sad Rashford face - and think that he should get a chance with a proper squad)
I need to be honest and say that I'm curious who from the squad is to blame. obviously, not the likes of Rashford, De Gea am I right?
No one is to blame. \n\nIt\u2019s a shitty period, but as stated last year and proving to be true this year. The club is rebuilding a squad. We\u2019ve had one transfer window, 3 players in (one was bought as a rotation option) and then we\u2019ve been clearing the deadwood: fellaini, Sanchez, Valencia, young, darmian, Lukaku, lingard in talks you be moved, the intentions are very clear. It doesn\u2019t always work out that a deadwood player goes out and his proper replacement is right there. I\u2019m giving till end of summer transfer window and at that point we should have a squad that we can put responsibility on ole for. \n\nNot only that, four of our best players are out in rashford, Pogba, mctominay and lindelof and with clearing deadwood, we don\u2019t have many options. Which is a problem, but for fucks sake people, a year ago everyone was throwing a fit that we have so much deadwood but it seems no one wants to be patient enough to go through the struggle that is getting rid of it.
No one is to be blamed, players like Pereira and Lingard are nowhere near good enough to be starting for United so you can't really blame them because there's no other choice. \n\nIt's up to Woodward sign some players.
Nobody is really to blame unless you buy into the Pogba as cancer line of thinking. They're just not good enough or knackered or young (Lingard, Pereira, Matic, James, Shaw, Mata... described everyone really).
We  haven't been able to dismantle teams under any manage since Ferguson. Our play in the final third has been a constant issue.
Woodward has gotten so much wrong at the club. Hiring the (relegated) ex-Cardiff and Molde manager with no top level experience wasn\u2019t his one stroke of genius.
I guess... but that also means we have will sit in a cycle of never having top tier players coming to play. It takes a special kind of player to be both worldclass AND want to join an organization that is running around like a headless chicken with the intention of completely turning things around.
I mean we hardly advertise ourselves well. We don't play good football and the results have become a disaster at times. I hate being pessimistic but were in a very bad position right now. Honestly Rashford being injured the way he was ruined this season for me. We ran our best player into the ground time and time again and this is the result.
I'm surprised this entire subs backs him then
Under the direction of the manager
> Under the direction of the manager\n\nThe manager needs to find som good coaches then, to help him with that.
Ole out, Ed out. Simpler.
Ed out, Ole out, almost every player out, simple
Tactics are dogshit, change that up
When your star striker can't score 2m in front of the keeper, tactics aren't your problem
And that's fine, I'm all for that, but not a manager from Norway with nothing on his managerial cv to suggest he can do the job. We look like a Sunday league team at times, no structure, no direction. It's shocking
\ud83d\ude02
Pretty much one season like this Jose was sacked and Ed comes out and says we are rebuilding and we trust in this process. Fucking prick doesn\u2019t understand shit about football but calls shots.
Basically admitted he has no clue how to fix things or get this team to best smaller teams.
Admitted he doesn\u2019t have a clue to fix things and got called out for being inexperienced by the commentators after.
Unless Woodward fucks off and stays on commercial while we hire DOF then that will end up being us.
The club has no problem attracting players with the wages there handing out.
I completely agree he's struggled to open up the lower block teams most of the season but there has been signs in recent games before Rashfords injury that they have learned to open up lower teams, Norwich and Brighton for example, but it's also obvious they are desperate for a better no.10 than what's there, there's one available and its a nightmare to get it done, that's not on Ole. I just want to see what he could do with a run of games with the full strength side, I still feel they can be great! As for Martial, an enigma, is a 9 is a LW who cuts inside? Who bloody knows, Jose gave up on him, plenty more might too, Mason keeps going the way he's going he will take the No.9 before long, I'd be worried if I was Martial.
Norwich are a team that tend to be open and have a go at teams and often leaving space behind to get into, which plays into the pace we have. Honestly I just feel Ole lacks any sense of knowing how to set the team up to play to their best of their abilities.\n\nWe have the likes of James, Williams, AWB who can run at fullbacks, and nearly every time they do it they cut back inside rather than trying to put the ball in the box and hope someone can get on the end of it. The only reason they don't do this has got to be on Ole and the coaching staff telling them not to. If Ole is telling them to do this and they still aren't then he's failing as a manager at getting his point across to the players and needs to go as he hasn't got the locker room.\n\nLook at Burnley today, they all knew what they had to do, they all know their roles in the team. I don't think a single one of our players know their's.\n\nAgreed with Martial, he's not our number 9 and shouldn't be playing through the center. In all fairness i'd drop him and play Greenwood to send a message. If he doesn't want to play as a number 9 then you're fighting with the likes of James for a spot in the wings.
Lmao Norwich and Brighton don't play with a low block. Are you just parroting comments or something? Or do you actually watch what's happening on the pitch?
I've been adamant from the beginning of the season that our 1st 11 is good enough for Top 4, but our depth is dangerously poor. We have long term injuries to two of our three starting midfielders, our starting left back and two our top scoring strikers at various points of this season. I think what we are seeing is that the lack of rotation (James, AWB, Fred) and let's face it inferior quality (Periera, Lingard, Mata sometimes) is resulting in what we see now, which is sloppy, leggy and flat performances.
All what you've said is true. But don't forget. We saw these performances at the beginning ofthis  season when everyone was well and fit. Crystal Palace at home. 10 man soton away. It's not a new problem. It's not solely down to injuries and depth. This team isn't being coached. It's not hard to see.
you're backing your team by not pumping money into the glazers' pocket
I'm not tearing down my club by being toxic, spouting shit at the players and letting OT become a joke of a ground where the only thing you'll ever hear is the away fans (although it's heading that way with the amount of plastics that currently attend).\n\nThe games I can afford to go to, you bet I'll be chanting with everyone, backing my team.
To be done by the end of the week?\n\nSure
Err, I could be wrong but I\u2019d hazard a guess that we generate a lot more money than Inter. Ole is doing everything in good faith, but Woodward/Glazers are spinning this whole thing as a rebuild and I really don\u2019t think for a second there is one. When Ashley Young turns down a contract extension, it speaks volumes. \n\nAlso, if there is a rebuild. I don\u2019t want that d1ckhead Ed anywhere near it.
I agree about not wanting Ed anywhere near. On the other, surely such a bullshitting wouldn't go well with the fans and the club would get less money from merchandising. Also, if just making the club worse was the plan, then a lot of sponsors would leave us and that would once again bring less money. Yes, from a money standpoint, it doesn't unfortunately matter where you are first or fourth (something Ed pretty much admitted), but if United were 6th every season, surely the amount of money that goes into the club would decrease massively. Let's not forget that a lot of money is in foreign markets like China and India, where people buy United merch still because of SAF era. This will slowly fade into darkness with people there buying City and Liverpool merchandise instead of ours. That would be another money lost. Surely that cannot be the way this club is going, because even if we look at United from the perspective of money, which is the only perspective Ed actually knows, then it doesn't make sense at all. Not pushing for the title and being happy with 4th place unfortunately makes sense financially, but definitely nothing less than that, so Ed can't be happy about our current state.
Exactly. That's where we at.  Very sobering.
This isn't a slight on Ole but the board.
It\u2019s a pretty disgusting situation all around. Having to sub on Lingard to get a goal..
I don't think he ever will be tbh. Some things can't be coached. Do you see a top manager fielding this guy week in week out?
He might, but I think he should be a squad player. He has the right skill set for that. He might surprise me, but I agree that he probably won't be a starter. On the other hand, he definitely has some great aspects of his play. He is insanely quick, he never stops running and his crossing is quite good when he plays on the right. He can also shoot those curling Robben shots when he cuts inside from the left. He absolutely shouldn't have been a starter this season though. He has been pretty good at that considering he came from the Championship and this is his Premier league season, but he is still to raw to play every week, which he unfortunately has to because we have nobody else right now.
He isn't the only one who is knackered. He's just not good enough at this level. We're accepting mediocrity
Tell me about and I can\u2019t remember too.
Spot on.
'If' is the word I see you using a lot.\n\nby all means sack Ole and hire Poch or any list of 'better' managers.\n\nLet's see where it gets us. Do you not think LVG and Mourinho are world class managers? They're serial winners. \n\nWhy do you think the board would in anyway improve they're transfer approach? It would end the exact same way. List of targets, one or two may be signed after wasting the entire window chasing them. We will overpay and we will continue to become a less desirable place to come and play football.\n\nWhat I saw on that pitch today wasn't a poor coaching display. It was poor quality football. A failure to finish easy chances in the first half and a complete inability to play a killer ball. This isn't FM, you can't take average players and turn them into Kevin de bruyne.
>'If' is the word I see you using a lot.\n\n... You mean once...? Really dude? Really? \n\n>Let's see where it gets us. Do you not think LVG and Mourinho are world class managers? They're serial winners.\n\nI do. \n\n>Why do you think the board would in anyway improve they're transfer approach? It would end the exact same way. List of targets, one or two may be signed after wasting the entire window chasing them. We will overpay and we will continue to become a less desirable place to come and play football.\n\nStrawman. Can't even be arsed. It's too frustrating. Just no. Not what I claimed. Try again. \n\n>What I saw on that pitch today wasn't a poor coaching display.\n\nWell then maybe you don't understand football. \n\n>It was poor quality football. A failure to finish easy chances in the first half and a complete inability to play a killer ball. This isn't FM, you can't take average players and turn them into Kevin de bruyne.\n\nAnother strawman. Well done. \n\nAs if our problems just came from finishing. Right lad. Sure. Okay.
You joke but I think subbing Pereira was a huge mistake. He was playing quite poorly with bad decisions and shit touches but he was involved in every positive movement and ran into good spaces, and he has those little moments of creation / finishing that could have turned the tide with a little luck. Zero threat second half, lots of chances first half.  \n\nI'm ole in but his subs can be shocking. Hard not to be when most of the players are shocking but still, Pereira for Mason, who didn't touch the ball for 30 minutes, Martial standing about, like for like fullbacks chasing a 2 nil lead... And, of course, Jesse Lingard
You are not wrong. Pereira was frustrating in first half but, even if the sub was 100% justified, Mason somehow managed to be less effective. I think Gomes may have been the better pick.\n\nRegardless, the following 2 subs are what frustrated me the most. They were basic post for post subs where the players subbed in are worse than the ones they replaced. If you're 2 goals down and playing at home, you go gung-ho and take risks, Gomes for Matic, overload on the flanks or even push more people into the box to give their defense something to think about. There's nothing more depressing than AWB beating his man/men only to cross into an empty box with Martial, our spearhead, strolling outside the box.\n\nThe squad is paper thin obviously, but I think Ole has a lot of questions to answer as well from a strategic and mentality point of view. The lack of fight and leadership on display was more worrying than anything else for me.
Might be made of very clumsy glass, but he\u2019s still a fucking warrior.
Linekar said the atmosphere is starting to get quite toxic and (not verbatim) there are quite a few issues round the club atm .. Phillip immediately jumped into def need to keep the manager, sign 2 players and it\u2019s fixed, throughout the season there\u2019s been positives to take such as young players and energy around the place. Other stuff too but that\u2019s gist of the annoying parts. \n\nMartin Keown was more honest, pointed out that this is the lowest points ever at this stage & 30 behind Liverpool which should be unacceptable, and ole cant last until summer.
No I just don't fancy reading a bunch of imbecile shit all the time. Ole OUT, fuck player A fuck player B etc.
dude who can he bring? who the fuck do we have in our squad? \n\nDybala would have been a peach of a signing but Woodward decided not to pay up when he found that he couldn't generate advert benefits off him.
Gomes
Dream thinking
Jones was our best player.\n\nJust because Fred touched the ball a lot doesn't mean he actually did anything with it, still far from convinced.  Not sure how you can pick Matic over Jones, Williams, Mata or AWB for MOTM though.
This is surely a joke right?
We\u2019ll both get downvoted now
Let them, it's woefully so predictable
Yep, he started Rashford in a home game against Colchester ffs. Arguably our most important player in a home game against a league 2 side.
All this highlights is the squad is nowhere near big enough. \n\nRashford decision was a rock and hard place. He brought him on to get a goal, in a game where if we failed to score and went out he\u2019d have been criticised even more. \n\nI feel sorry for Ole. His hands are tied.
[deleted]
Like the commentator said: **If you're complaining about Rashford being injured for United, you've got to remember that Ashley Barnes is injured for Burnley too.**\n\nHe might not be as good as Rashford, but he's as important to Burnley as Rashford is to United.
I mean he is also part of the problem.
Fergie would struggle with this club atm. Shambles.
[deleted]
Nothing gets better until change from the top down begins. That simple really.
Man United under Ole this season have conceded 10 goals from set pieces and scored 4 - that's an outright fail on coaching.\n\nNot a drop of leadership being shown by the squad (as painfully highlighted by today's Burnley game, who also were dealing with injuries) - that starts from the top, but is primarily a fail on coaching as part of game management.\n\nPlayers were let go with the intention to mold 'hungry young players' - this is OGS' modus operandi and we're left with no attacking options and an infamously inconsistent Martial who's our only \"striker\" (thinking of Lukaku and Sanchez leaving and no replacements pursued) - that's joint Woodward and OGS.\n\nMaguire is proving to be a massive waste of money. Additionally, OGS has NO TRACK RECORD except getting sacked by Cardiff in the CHAMPIONSHIP.\n\nOGS might not be THE problem but he's most certainly not the solution...and from an image perspective to help us recruit, we need a coach to provide a solution for some short-term results AND a structural reorg.
Malaysia mate
Well, if you have centre backs that are doing absolutely jack shit...
Players always want a new challenge, and this indeed is a tough tough challenge
Case in *fucking* point.
Cheers m8, appreciate it.
Sure we have a shit squad but what is Ol\u00e9's style and tactics other than counter attacking. Everyone knows we struggle against a deep block and yet Ol\u00e9 can't come up with anything
then explain how he hasn't instead of 'lmfao'.. Nice grown up debate \ud83d\udc4d
the fact that we are close to 4th with perreria or lingard at no.10. Dan James a completely new player to PL playing almost every game. Fred  playing alongside matic and mata players way past there prime in midfield. Ole clearly has been working miracles. If he is fired its going to be the same process again. Maybe some short term success but long term we will be the same.
>the fact that we are 4th\n\nThis is very much not a fact lmao
Williams and Greenwood.\n\nWe desperately needed Fullbacks and scorers.
This right here. We would all take our car to an expert. Ole is not an expert.
Im not Ole in or out, but the car\u2019s been vomiting smoke non-stop since Fergie and all we\u2019ve done to address it is swap out the exact same part over and over. So surely something else is the underlying problem?
yeah and then you take it to the mechanic and pay him to fix it, not trying to keep driving around in the piece of shit
So you buy another car and refuse to accept that your dealer has been selling you shitty cars?
holy shit people are fucking terrible at analogies.
So using the same analogy, changing mechanics wouldnt solve the problem if you cant buy any parts to  repair it to begin with. Thats my take on it. Its hard to blame ole given how bad our squad depths are.
>My bet would be that if we sack Ole and get Poch in, the latter would fare just as well as Ole in the next two years if not worse. \n\nI completely agree. Im not saying ole is the best manager but i need to see the board back him up first before deciding to sack him. Mourinho has been screaming for signings back then and i think the only reason why he didnt speak out now is because he signed a non disclosure agreement with Ed.
Yep. I'll always refer to this and some other comments I've made about Matic, Shaw, Martial in my comment history. I care f*** all about my internet points (reddit karma). I would rather be in the minority and be right than be stupid and short-sighted like most emotional and reactionary people here who always come out to comment after we lost.
Not hating him at all. He has been shafted. We need a manager who can succeed without proper backing and Poch can.
Clearly not.
Appreciate it.
i said it when he got appointed,Absolute crazy decision ,Keane had better credentials at least he wouldn't be a puppet if your going for that legend rhetoric
Keane would be a shite coach lol, he has no temper
I said it when Moyes was appointed.
I remember last year i think it was the Liverpool match ,To me he played lingard who was not fit he got taken off after 20 mins same also happened with shaw in the same match.\nTactically its freestyle football.\nout of his depth.\nThe board to give him a contract after the PSG game which every fan knows was a fluke with the rewarding of the penalty shows how inept the club is being run.\nIts criminal to let him to be in charge of rebuilding job.\nLook at graham potter at Brighton did a great job abroad and look how he has transformed them ,They might not have the budget of a top team but they play great football atm.\nGraham potter is miles above Ole.\nOle is a legend \nand its up to him if he wants that tarnished.\nGet poch in give him complete control over staff ,transfers and youth development policy and watch what a real manager can do
Better continue with this shit then try and change.
We've been through this shit 3 times, you know that they won't learn anything as long as profit goes up.
If you think Ole isn't part of the problem you're deluded too
Notice the word \"solely\"?
My comment in no way indicates this is soley on Ole.
One thing to say he isn't good enough for the job, but it's completely wrong to straight up insult him.
Didn't we throw at lot of Insults at Jose ? \nDid you hear the  Woodward songs fans were singing last night ?
When 3 of your important players are injured, what can you do ? Calling him a clown is like insulting your mom.
They could be player manager because our squad needs uninjured players more than manager
*Something*??
Come as a peaceful Chelsea fan not trying to start arguments, but didn\u2019t Mourinho take pretty much this team to second?
If you mean this club plus Paul Pogba & Romelu Lukaku.\n\nPogba not playing has been an absolute fucking disaster. He's the best player by far, so not playing in what was already a paper thin midfield leads to what you're seeing now.
Lol, match fans are the ones who bitch about the Glazers yet give them money by going to every match. They're just a bunch of hypocrites.
So you are happy with us defending with 5 players with 10 minutes to go and 2 goals down? Against 1 of their players when everyone else is at home. And are you happy with us subbing in Shaw and Lingard when we are chasing goals?
Ofc there are players who can step up. Just tell the players to move up on the pitch. We don't need Mata to be next to the centerbacks along with Matic and Fred when we are chasing goals.
Nah your right but our midfielders come to get the ball in centre defence because they can't bring the ball forward. We've had this problem with Pogba for ages he comes deep to start the attack because the defence simply can't. \n\nRather than our creative players getting the ball at the half way line they have to get it at our box because we just don't have enough quality to get it out otherwise. We should be able to start the attack from defence but it seems like we just can't
Yeah, he might not want to leave, but if anything, we are the club Palace would be willing to sell to, due to us having the 25% sell on clause.
I know there are bigger issues but you can't sit there and tell me that Ole is excelling in every area that he is directly responsible for. I want the Glazers out as much as the next fan and will continue to support (albeit in a small way online etc) but I look at Ole and think he just isn't working well with what he's got.
He's clearly not excelling but the vast majority calling for his head do it bc they don't know what else to say. \n\nI don't know what the right move is. I just know that I don't get a great feeling from the idea of poch in. The turnover of managers is part of the problem, poch hasn't shown anything to suggest he's the solution, the one positive is that he doesn't play a vastly different style to ole so transition won't be as awkward as lvg -> mou -> ole. \n\nI can't see him doing much better with this squad. A lot of his shortcomings are similar to ole. He is also slightly vindicated in the sense that spurs are still struggling under Mourinho, and it might not be his fault it went wrong there either, although it's too early to tell. It just feels like change for the sake of it though, and long term our issues will be the same. \n\nOle has individually improved a lot of our players, but the collective cohesion clearly remains inconsistent as fuck. In terms of today, we started really well and had some well worked moves with a clear plan to work it out to the fullbacks where possible and load the box for low crosses. It worked, but we couldn't finish. \n\nBurnley strike out of nowhere, and the fact that it's 1-0 at half time imo isn't on ole (although our set piece coaching could well be below par). \n\nThe second half was shocking. A consistent theme that you can say ole has failed to address is our inability to recover from losing positions. \n\nThere was a clear lack of ideas in the second half, and our squad depth accounts for a lot of our struggles here too, with limited bench options and tired legs on the pitch. But yes whether it be mentality or tactics ole needed to get more out of the team second half. \n\nThat would be my assessment. Not great but not shit, issues aren't his fault but he fails to solve a lot of them. At the same time look at what he has to work with. I think from a managers perspective he will point to the way we conceded and say \"what can I do about that\", and point to the missed chances, but anyone can see United could have done more. \n\nHe's clearly not perfect. But ole to poch feels like a panicky bandaid move in a lot of ways.
Oh I am Glazers out but if you think Ole will out last the Glazers you are deluded. Ole is on his way out and rightly so.
So did Jose but the real fans were complaining both Van Gaal's and Jose's team weren't meeting the attacking standards of Manchester United
van gaal and jose has proven to be great managers, but the board had there own agendas and we were all wrong about them. especially jose, since he left i have come to see how he was right about many things. the big heads are happy with their poster boy so they will never sack him, not that i think it will be a solution (it won't) but he will need to go eventually if we really want to rebuilt our once great club. i will never stop being a fan but i refuse to support them until they fix that mess that is Manchester united. i will not buy another merchandise or watch another game until they fix what they broke. i won't even post about them on social media anymore, fuck it, imma unfollow them; until they fix that shit show.
That's for you perhaps, but I would take them because they fucking understand how football is important for a football club. The difference between Abramovich and the Glazers has always been glaring: one is bathed in football culture long enough to understand what it means to stay competitive by all means; the others are nothing but greedy money-pinching pricks - a very bad kind of human being to have as an owner or a CEO of any company.
Thanks for that, kind of what I was expecting which is disappointing
It was so depressing to watch. Players absolutely have no clue. Can't see any discernable patterns of play either
Success isn't built entirely on a team \"wonderkids\" alone. That's the state we're in atm. We have too many of these guideless young players, to the point that we're relying on them to step up into the unknown and bring success. Comparing Madrid to the likes of us is retarded also, as there are quality players on all positions in that club to nurture the youths. What quality players do we have to nurture ours? Mata? Maguire? Signing future prospects alone won't work without a proper structure of the club, which this club is lacking.
Fair point. Having watched our game today, he probably wishes he had.
Are you serious? If anyone they were on Maguire
To be fair Jones didn\u2019t cost 80 mill. That doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that he is a donkey though
Both goals down Jones\u2019 side, they had nothing on their right. Dunno maybe we watched a different match.
He was maybe our best player
Aside from him conceeding a free kick with a clumsy challenge that led to the first goal you mean? Or have we reached such a low point that people are now standing up for Phil Jones?
Yes that's the result, but the performance, while nowhere near good enough, still deserved more than that
I mean sadly our best attacking sub today has had 0 goals in over a year so. I'll take 3 goals...
Exactly what I mean haha he\u2019ll fit right in ahead of most of our current attackers
Lol the first line was if you ignore everything bad it\u2019s all good right now.
Yeah, now every smart ass is going to use that line.
Yeah because it was a fucking absurd post
That post is the best way to describe the cult of Ole that rules this sub.
In my view it was the correct call, as I want to win something. However, Looking back it is obvious that he should not have prioritized it that much.
I like Ole but To me this was inexcusable. Everyone could see our team was WAYYYY too thin and we\u2019re playing Pogba straight off an injury for 90 minutes in the Carabao?! Not to mention no rotation through the entire Carabao and FA. The league was way more important and he didn\u2019t properly prioritize rests imo.
Or we have hired the wrong manager every time.
More than possible! I truly don't know what the right thing to do is anymore.
And just pray, what is contes league position right now? And how many players has he brought in since the start of the season?
That was at Chelsea, nothing to do with his current job.
Did you come from the Ed Woodward school of transfers? We can quite easily manage to call both of them out at the same time, we don't have to wait.\n\nAnd the idea of the Glazers selling before they're good and ready is a childish fantasy.
100% agree. Are people incapable of blaming more than one party at a time?
Wrong on the account Rom would get us goals.\n\n\nMartail been doing what of late?
We're in the same boat. And Ole is at fault, hardly anyone can hold an argument against that. But my opinion (and it is just an opinion) replacing Ole won't fix anything till we solve the issues above him.
No idea why Maguire deserves comparison with these players, at least 3 of them are/were better CBs than him. \n\nWhat has he done that make fans stand up for him this way? He is a really poor transfer not only in terms of cost but what he was supposed to bring \u2014 he isnt totally shit but a fairly good CB, but he was supposed to be a key player in turning it around and he just isn\u2019t on that level.
Neither did Maguire
I'll let the mountain of downvotes you will receive speak for themselves.
could give 2 shits
Doing God\u2019s work
If we can't beat Burnley I don't know who we can beat..... I'm going to sleep too depressed to deal with thisshit...
True, also Klopp is far more than a \u2018good\u2019 manager he\u2019s the world\u2019s best.
They have good prawn sandwiches
Only time will tell.
Fair, maybe people cba with United, when I try go buy tickets it\u2019s usually pretty full so I guess I\u2019m part of the problem too
For 80 minutes, at least...
Everton yay.
Fergie must be looking at this club thinking \"What the hell?\"
Losing 2-0 at home to Burnley guarantees that there will be nothing good in this thread!
stats lie to me.\n\nbut yeah, i am expecting too much.\n\nedit: didn't have clue how bad is burnley, and defeated by them.
Fair point, I was just passing on a tweet I found but I guess it doesn't tell you the story of recent times in the PL. I feel this is caused by having more high quality teams in the PL due TV money. You look at a team like Wolves, Sheffield & Leicester and these teams just didn't do well 15 years ago. League feels a lot more competitive (except at the top.)
Yes that\u2019s fair enough :)
No worries! I think you're absolutely right and it highlights another important aspect: what and where to channel negativity and criticism.\n\nWhat we're seeing is several years of incompetence throughout the club, particularly at the club. One of the reasons why our squad is so messed up is because we've hired polar opposite managers one after another; managers with completely different philosophies and ideas, which result in a wide array of different players, too. \n\nNot to mention the wage structure, which is another weird combination of things, including the board's reluctance to invest heavily and being assertive in the transfer market. Several players who should've been shipped out have had their contracts extended because there's no replacements lined up and the squad is already paper thin. \n\nAll of that, plus a myriad of other issues, is why I'm not very fond of Ole getting sacked. I don't think he's doing great, I don't think he's a long-term option, but I don't fucking trust Woodward and the Glazers with another pivotal decision. Despite his flaws, he does bring some stability and a vision going forward in terms of signings. The problem is that that should've been the job of a DoF! And I'm not blind to the fact that what I perceive as stability and vision, in the end, might not mean anything. Why? Because that's what we (at least I remember I did) thought about LVG. Then he gets sacked and we bring in, although a world-class manager, someone who plays entirely different. It pretty much rendered everything LVG had worked on useless. That's not to shy away from the fact that LVG's football has horrible to watch. I literally wanted to gauge my eyes out standing in Stretford End watching us get a narrow 1-0 victory over Aston Villa, which was at the time one of the worst teams I'd seen and already relegated. \n\nIn short, I personally don't want to see Ole gone until we put some fucking leash on Woodward along with upgrading our entire club structure. Woodward is, by all accounts, doing great on the business side but I just hope they lock him away from football matters and install a proper system that, to a certain extent, guarantees consistency and cohesiveness across multiple managers.
Fully agree with you, I've said it before and I'll say it again. Keep Woodward for the business and get in a soccer expert / proven in that role.\n\nI would respond in more detail but I'm knackered and wanted to say I appreciated the discussion. Good night!

Cheers mate maths is tough af flopped my exam so hard today but thought yk what i can look forward to United playing later!!
Hahaha tell me about it, 3rd year Maths student here ;)\n\nHad the pleasure of not having Jan exams this year, was buzzed. Shame it's been ruined by the Glazers loool\n\nEdit: pray for moderation!
It was embarrassing but I hope the banter stayed in the comments and that OP wasn\u2019t bombarded with abuse privately. But in the state we\u2019re in that\u2019s probably wishful thinking.
He got abused? Man, fucks wrong with people?
- Ole isn't responsible for negotiations for Maguire. He shouldn't be held accountable for the fee we paid for Harry. I'd however turn the question around and ask you which better CB was available in the summer that we could have bought instead, or even any other cost effective solution.\n\n- James was bought to be a squad player who could maybe turn into a starter someday. We got what we wanted with him.\n\nWan Bissaka buy was a no brainer, but how many times have we seen us not make deals that should have been a no brainer.\n\nI would be happy if we could at least start doing those simple things right.
Every manager we say the same shit we need a overhaul. We don\u2019t need a overhaul we need a board with vision. (Period)
We need both, why are we playing Rashford when he has two injuries? That's not the board that's the medical team and the manager. The board might have left us with a thin team but play unorthodox, hell throw in an academy player just keep your players healthy.
Rooney can replace Pereira even right now
My point is we're going through our worst season in aeons and Solskjaer is getting a pass. The quality of the squad under Moyes is not relevant, 800M later
I know they move it too slow. I know it. But that's precisely the thing a better player would do(move it faster) and maybe make the others follow the example. Don't know for sure.
Even the most average players can be drilled to move the ball quickly, this is 100% a coaching issue not a personnel one. I can give you so many examples of bottom half PL teams or even Championship teams who move the ball with more authority than us.
I also think he should have tried another formation (s)
Yes. But we all know that's the problem with United, too. 'Being right' isn't much help in fixing stuff.\n\nWhat we need right now is a DoF. And the way to get one isn't for Ole to mouth off about the board in public, get sacked, and a new manager come in asking for control over transfers. The way to get a DoF is for the narrative to shift onto the Glazers and Ed being the problem, not the manager.
I don't know man, I myself have no opinion. I'm just tagging along on this wild ride and whatever happens, happens.\n\nI'm not informed enough to be #oleIN or #oleOUT. But sometimes it does feel like if you really care about the club (as most people claim ole does and I'm sure he does) more than your job security, then you would call out the top brass because the current state is dire.\n\nThere have been no signings apart from the 3 in the summer and they have been quality, so I'm pretty sure, not having a DOF is not the problem we have, as if the rumours are to be believed, Ed has the final say . But I'm pretty sure they're fatigued right now because of lack of rotation due their importance to the team. Set pieces are horrible and our pressing makes me think that what Klopp does is some alien shit.\n\nStill, I'd like to see the board take some blame and ole to go balls out in public too (I know the club gets bad repute with manager mouthing off).
I think it was pretty clearly our go-to for when burnley had got back into shape if nothing happened on the transition. Mata started wide then made runs inside and we seemed to be working triangles with the aim of freeing up space for wan bissaka. This gave him time to aim low deliveries rather than just whip it in and it worked really well. We also had a lot more men in the box than we usually do, it was clearly structured and rehearsed with the aim of stretching a low block. I think we'll see more of that type of play in similar matches.
Thanks, I never thought Id see reasonable analysis in a post match thread. :)
And those names, bar Pogba, highlights another problem which we've known since summer: they were never replaced. On top of that we don't have a proper backup for the type of player Pogba is neither.
You don\u2019t need to have creative players in order to have an attacking style or philosophy. The players don\u2019t know what to do around or in the box to break a team down.
> The players don\u2019t know what to do around or in the box to break a team down.\n\nYeah because we don't have the creative players to make something happen or to pick a clever pass?\n\nGetting to the final third is easy, but we are useless once we get there, as you say!
The manager should be using the squad better to beat teams like Burnley tbh I understand the Liverpool game. This one? No fucking way
What squad???? Lingard? What players do we have that can break down a side like Burnley?
Put any great manager in right now and nothing will change. Ed will still be a spinless dickhead and we'll be having the same discussion after a season or two( see: all Managers after SAF)
A great manager will make us win the winnable games we lost.\n\nA great manager will make us play with a good system, not just relying on one single tactic.\n\nRemember that our squad isn't on a Southampton level, our current group of players are good enough to compete for top 4. You can blame injuries, but even when McTominay and Rashford were not injured, we still drew/lost games we should've won.\n\nI know Ole is a legend in the club and therefore we default to defending him, but saying a great manager won't do better than Ole is blind fanatism.
Fuck that, burn it all to the ground and let it ride again from the ashes.
I wasn\u2019t defending Ole as I don\u2019t think he\u2019s perfect. But he certainly doesn\u2019t have xavi and iniesta to work with. Nobody can do anything better with the team we have and it\u2019s simple as that. I feel for Ole because clearly he wants players we\u2019re just to fucking incompetent to sign anyone even on loan.
A lot of managers can do better with this team, sure they won't be challenging for the title but they can get a tune out of these. This squad on paper is better than the one that finished second in the league.
Maguire- 80m\n\nFred - 60m\n\nMartial - 40m\n\nWan Bissaka - 30m\n\nI might have gotten some of these figures wrong but my point is that we have a decent squad that in no circumstances should have lost to god damn Burnley 2-0 at home, everything is going wrong and this is a slippery downward slope we\u2019re heading.\n\nIn other clubs, I would think the outcomes would have been vastly different - Ed would have been out a long long time ago
Not defending Ole, this is Woodward\u2019s fault. Hired unfit managers and let the club rot.
I read it totally incorrectly. Very sorry about that.
Not really an excuse, just think the majority of the anger should be directed at the higher ups. Woodward hired all these coaches that aren\u2019t good enough and let the club rot.
that\u2019s the trick, though. they defend ole by saying \u201cjose couldn\u2019t do it either\u201d while ignoring that jose still, even at his worst, was never this bad. the stats bear that out. so, no, jose couldn\u2019t do it, but he did better than this! \n\nand since when is someone else\u2019s failure an argument that we should ignore the current failures?
Jose has won more trophies than people have on FIFA, if he can\u2019t figure it out then neither will Ole so it\u2019s a perfect example. Point your blame at Woodward, the man that hires these managers and let\u2019s our club rot.
He can\u2019t figure it out because it\u2019s not his managerial style? He **always** has experienced reliable forwards wherever he has been successful, Martial and Rashford under Jose were not at the level to do what a Jose frontline does, which is fashion out chances for themselves. It\u2019s really not a perfect example at all, I can point the blame at more than one person simultaneously, you know that right? There are coaches out there capable of getting more from this squad, neither Jose or Ole are one of them.
You honestly think our squad is worse than Burnley's???
Or we could get a coach who could play decent football?
You keep saying this, but what coach is going to get this team to play good football?
Lmao, you make Burnley at home sound like playing Barca, it's Burnley for fuck sake, not some unstoppable force. They were 14th
Yeah the same team Leicester couldn't beat either.
Who would you play? It isn't wise to throw in youth players suddenly into the first team. We need quality additions to the squad to displace the likes of Pereira, Lingard.
Greenwood was on the bench, he should be starting over Pereira whenever possible.
Our squad, even with the injuries should do far far better. We've been shit since March, even when Pogba was in the side it was dross. It wasn't tiredness that lost us today's game. It was the fact we had no idea what to do when faced with an organised defence (for the billionth time). We're 4 points ahead of a team who's forwards have scored a combined total of one league goal (Newcastle). The teams I've mentioned have  shocking squads and the fact we're competing with them is an embarrassment to all associated with club. \n\nI just don't understand what people see in Ole. I so hoped it would work out but the reality is that he's managed Cardiff and Molde and isn't cut out for the elite.
Here's my problem. We got in Moyes, who spent money on players for a particular style of play. Then we got in LvG, who spent money on players for a different style of play. Then we got in Jose Mourinho, who spent money on players for a different style of play. Then we got in Ole, who spent money on players for a different style of play.\n\nUnited have spent a fortune on a mismatched squad. Some of them are ageing. Some of them are too young. A lot of them are crap. Some of them don't meet our style any more.\n\nHere's an example; Ole wants to play 'breaking at pace.' I actually like that style. But why the fuck did the club buy Matic then? The answer is that Mourinho wanted him for a different type of football.\n\nIf we change our manager again, this will happen again. I agree a manager can make a difference. But with a bag of mixed goods like we have it also takes time. So I'm Ole-in until we get a DoF. Because we can't keep changing strategies like this. And at the moment I'm Ole-in because I prefer the players we have been buying recently to the ones we got under Jose and LvG.\n\nI'd also add that it looks to me like Ole's been asked to clear out the deadwood and progress a strategy. I actually agree with that strategy. It's just ponderously slowly implemented because we apparently can't do more than one transfer at a time and can't close deals quickly.\n\nSo I'd want to see Ed moved to tractor/noodle deals only, and Matt Judge moved to another club - before I think it's time to change managers.
thanks for the answer. I have the second line of thought, but since I may be wrong, I want to understand correctly what is happening, because I am a soccer fan and although we are rivals, I recognize how great you guys were.
You're welcome, mate. It's a really tough situation to be in and I understand all the concerns about us. I believe in Ole as well, but our board is just ruining every chance he might have. The club has been run poorly for 7 years and nobody really rebuilt the team after sir Alex Ferguson retired, so every manager came into a situation where he had unusable players in his squad and tried fixing it with bringing experienced players. Not only that, but two of history's amazing coaches - Van Gaal and Mourinho - both failed because they weren't backed properly by our board, since it is apparently up to our CEO who doesn't understand football to make footballing decisions and he likes to decide things himself, so when Mourinho said he needed center backs, Woodward just told him no.\n\nIt all just slowly went very bad when Glazers bought the club, since the focus changed to making money and only Ferguson was special enough to actually be able to work with what he was given, but he also had a competent CEO in David Gill, who retired with Fergie and he was replaced by Woodward.\n\nIn short, the club is in a very bad place with a lot of players being either bad-to-average in vital positions (like Lingard and Pereira), old and past their prime (Mata, Matic, arguably De Gea because he isn't the best in the world anymore), injury prone (Martial, Bailly, Dalot, Jones, Rojo, Shaw, Matic), injured for a long time (Pogba, Rashford, McTominay) or too young to be consistent every match (Greenwood, James, Williams,..). All in all, everything just resulted into our current situation, where two of our top world-class players (Rashford and Pogba) are injured, our goalscoring threat is nearly non-existent because Martial plays more supporting role and Greenwood is too young. Take into account the fact, that we play 4231 formation without a good creative midfielder and without a good defensive midfielder and it just gets you into the place we are at right now.\n\nHopefully we come back sooner or later though, so that there can actually be competition between our teams once again. Cheers
I disagree, rumours of Andres Herrera leaving and Fellaini leaving in the winter should have signalled to the upper management and Ole that barring an injury outbreak or a flurry of red cards, the midfield options look a bit light yea. The one positive that we can take this season, it's that Ed and the upper management have finally started to sell some players but failed to add back into the squad. Some the players should have been sold years ago but were instead given hefty contracts renewals.
What exactly do you disagree with? \n\nI completely agree that they needed replacement, but it hasn\u2019t happened yet. Hence giving him another window to get the replacements wanted in.
Yeah, I totally agree. It's like when I start the same lineup 45 games in a row in FM20 and my star player gets hurt for 3 months with ligament injuries. Yet I'm still surprised...
Another failure of the manager, not appointing the right team
Can't shoot, can't pass can't defend and you don't question what might be happening in training?
I never said that they played low block, I said they were lower teams that we opened up. Norwich do play on front foot I'll agree that played into our hands but the comment was that we struggled against teams lower than us in the league and I'm saying that we have shown at times this season that we have gotten good results and performances in some of them. Or did you miss those games?!
His crossing is genuinely hit and miss because he seldom looks up before whipping it in, on top of that his decision making is also suspect.\n\n I struggle to see what he excels at beyond just being a player with pace. He started well but the goals have dried up, 5 months and counting now. His assists return has been very good but he's also only managed 2 assists in the league in the last four months.\n\n Its hard to tell if he really has those skills in his locker naturally to one day be consistent or be a specialist at them (like the curling shots cutting in from the left).
His crossing is a bit like that, but that doesn't change the fact that he created a lot of goalscoring opportunities since the beginning of the season, with most of them not being converted because our players weren't in the right place. If he actually practices with our attackers and learns to put crosses instinctively where our attackers will try to be, then he will be a really useful player. Don't forget that I said he should be a really good squad player in the future, not a guaranteed starter. As a squad player, he doesn't necessarily have to be consistent every match, he just has to show up when necessary and with his energy and speed coming from the bench, he should be able to. There should be better players at his position though, since I agree he isn't really a starter material.\n\nHe really excels at quick counter attack (pace, how surprising) and honestly, I think he might be the best crosser in the club right now. Not that he has much competition, but there have been many times this seasons when he runs with Rashford, looks where Marcus is and sets him up with a perfect pass. That's the main difference between him and Andreas, Andreas bottles so many chances with his decisions and passing, while James might be invisible most of the time but when he gets unmarked into an opportunity to create something, he usually does. That's why he should be an amazing squad player, something Ole most likely bought him for.
Aren't you a condescending cunt.\n\nAppreciate you only used it once, thought I saw it a couple of times, my bad. Regardless I stand by what I said, you directly said 'if the board show intent', to which I asked why they would change the transfer approach? It's been over 7 years of the same approach and I'm not sure why a new manager would change that, enlighten me into how that's a strawman lad?\n\nI think fundamentally you are entirely whats wrong with this fanbase. I'm all for discussion, I'm more than happy for you to contest my opinion, we're fans at the end of the day, none of us as experts, we see what we see and we formulate our views. However, they're are fans like yourself who think you've got some entitled right to attack someone's right to think something. You think you're view has any more weight to it than mine or the next man's? You're telling me you have no idea how anyone can have a 'counter argument' to getting rid of Ole asif people who back the manager are morons and because Mata and Martial aren't able to finish quite simple chances that arent really coaching issues that I can't view it as lack of quality. Attack the argument not the person.\n\nDon't think I've ever seen anyone big up Ole as a master tactician or coach, most just merely see it as an issue from the top down, I don't think he's a united calibre coach but I don't think that honestly matters right now.\n\nIrony of you calling strawman when it's the very thing you've finished off with, cockwomble.
>Aren't you a condescending cunt.\n\nIt only sounds condescending because you're too stupid to understand what's going on mate. \n\n>Appreciate you only used it once, thought I saw it a couple of times, my bad.

I mean, just the grammar alone makes me wonder whether you actually think before you write something. I don't mind you calling me a condescending cunt for that. \n\nI mean, what argument am I supposed to be attacking here? I literally said twice that you were arguing a strawman. I have attacked your argument. They're shit. You ask what would happen if we sack the manager. I explained what I think would happen. Can you not read? \n\nIs your only argument for keeping Ole that the players didn't finish well enough? Does that excuse our overall gameplan? Does that excuse just how lethargic the team is? Does that excuse the lack of a plan to break down a defense? Is that literally all on the players too? What am I supposed to be attacking here lmao.\n\nBy the way, it is pretty rich that you're whining that I'm attacking the person, when you called me a condescending cunt. Talk about attacking the person. This is exactly why I think your opinion is worthless. Everyone can have an opinion, doesn't mean they're all worth the same. \n\n>Don't think I've ever seen anyone big up Ole as a master tactician or coach, most just merely see it as an issue from the top down, I don't think he's a united calibre coach but I don't think that honestly matters right now.\n\nWhy would it not matter? What kind of argument is that? Of course it matters. \n\n>Irony of you calling strawman when it's the very thing you've finished off with, cockwomble.\n\nIt's literally an argument you made twice. \n\n\" failure to finish easy chances in the first half\"\n\n\"because Mata and Martial aren't able to finish quite simple chances\"\n\nOr are you REALLY going to make the argument that our overall game isn't something the manager should be able to control? If you REALLY are going to make that argument, then your opinion is actually less than worthless.
It's no joke. But it is a sign of the times alright.
Again, all you are doing is highlighting the squad isn\u2019t big enough. Which isn\u2019t his fault.
The \"half fit Pogba\" attended his bro's wedding and danced up a storm. \n\nThe \"half fit Pogba\" attended his bro's charity match and played.
>Nothing gets better until change from the top down begins. \n\nThis is simply not true.\n\nOur tactics, coaching, and performances could definitely improve.\n\nWe're not going to challenge for the title without top down change and transfers, but c'mon. \n\nObviously Woodward needs to go and a good DoF needs to be appointed. But anyone who thinks good coaching couldn't have been the difference between Champions League and Europa Leage is wrong.
I would sacrifice anything to rid this club of those awful people. If you look at any part of the club it could be better; tactics, coaching, on field performances, physio, training, transfers, pr, etc. I see one way of making it better. No reason to sacrifice our club for a few months of wins that may or may not get us CL, which, if we did get, would justify keeping any and all of the current regime, top to bottom, around. Glazer's out, Woodward out, burn it down, build it back stronger.
he is tactically retarded
It doesn't mean a better manager won't play to the strengths of his players instead of trying to force his players to play only one way. We saw this with LVG and Jose....shit teams and still won trophies.
And how does that team compare to Ole's ? This team is shittier, and full of youngsters.
Fuck Woodward. \n\nAnd the toxic Jose shit was unwarranted, he dragged this team to a second place finish and multiple trophies. May have lost the team, but still not okay to insult.
Agreed
That is fine if it is one of our midfielders doing so. But how many times have we seen when Mata goes down to get the ball at the halfway line that right next to him are Matic and Fred?! We needed to get 3 goals and we had 5 players who were further down than their attacking player. No wonder we don't create anything. \n\nI really want to see Ole get the chance under a board that actually support him. Getting the players we need. But today he should get alot of blame for playing such passive tactic when we needed to score. Subbing in Lingard is just stupid.
It's games like this where having Lukaku could have saved us some points. This game was crying out for a striker who could impose himself and potentially get on the end of something. Not having him this season is hurting us
Well laid out points and agree with them.\n\nMy issue with Ole has been the lack of a definitive style of play, his substitutions (he hasn't got a lot to work with) and his whole demeanour in press conferences/interviews.\n\nChanging the manager isn't going to magically make us world beaters or solve the issue of shit recruitment, poor coaching and damn near negligent medical team BUT we need a man who can go in and be strong enough to say \"this club needs a DoF I can work with, this is how we want to play, these are our 10 bright young stars, these are 15 senior players (at the club or not) that will fit that system and let's get back to challenging\".\n\nI don't know, I'm dreaming I guess, probably wouldn't be supported in that way but the lack of direction and a DoF is killing us.
I agree a DoF is necessary. I do think the vision/ direction and style of play is there, but execution is clearly lacking. \n\nI do feel for ole because he's basically been managing in four competitions with a close to 15 man squad at times. I think one reason we suck at turning games around is clearly evidenced in the subs he made - a talented 18 year old at half time is the biggest statement of intent sub available, and the weapons at his disposal for trying to go all out attack are a left back and a man who hasn't scored a league goal in over a year. Plus fred looked knackered imo, for example. I can't help but feel he's gonna be injured soon and I don't even want to know what our midfield will look like at that point.
Good on you, I'm afraid supporting the club at this current time can be a bit toxic ATM. We will bounce back (say 20-30 years) and be free from the clutches of Glazers and Co. soon unless they are immortal then we are all fucked; hang around if you want but know that this will not get easier anytime soon
Yeah, I'm starting to get a gut feeling that the club won't be winning much for a long long time unfortunately
Seriously watch the goals again
Mate I\u2019m texting you straight from Old Trafford, Maguire was fine.
Yes, a little memeing will certainly help.
Damn, you are one angry fan
Bro i dont know how you do it man this is my first year and im struggling with the basic modules \ud83d\ude2d\n\n\nJan exams have killed me because obviously ive done no revision over Christmas and new year \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02
Ahh I remember first year lol\n\nWhat uni are you at?\n\n>Jan exams have killed me because obviously ive done no revision over Christmas and new year\n\nDw about it, all you need to do is pass and you should have a decent amount of time off in April to revise
I know there was some banter in the match thread and some went back to the post and commented, including me, but I hope no one crossed the line.
you know they did
Why did we sell lukaku before buying a striker? Why did we loan out Alexis? Why are we not signing a midfielder when scot and Pogba are out for the rest of the season ffs atleast get a loanee. I am not supporting Ole but our big problem is board and ole has one player who was scoring and he is using him can\u2019t blame him or can\u2019t blame him entirely.
No I know. That game was crying out for Lukaku I think he would have gotten us a goal or two that game for sure. I just don't know how were gunna see out the next month when were playing literally every three days
> There have been no signings apart from the 3 in the summer and they have been quality, so I'm pretty sure, not having a DOF is not the problem we have,\n\nLet's be honest, I'm just some guy on the Internet. A fan, like you. But in my opinion, the fault *is* that we don't have a DoF. It just starts some time back.\n\nThe problem is, historically, Moyes arrived and bought players to fit his style. Then LvG arrived, and bought players to fit *his* style. Then Mourinho arrived and bought players to fit *his* style. Now Ole's arrived, and bought players to fit *his* style.\n\nI actually like Ole's plan - it's 'get players young enough to improve,' and 'break at pace'. But you have to ask - if that's the plan, why the hell did the club buy Matic? He's slow and old. Well, the answer is 'Mourinho wanted him for the plodding football he wanted to play.'\n\nSo I'm saying two things simultaneously:\n\na) If we change the manager before we get a DoF, we'll need to change strategy again, and the team will remain a mess of competing ideas.\n\nand\n\nb) The reason we're so bad is because we don't have a DoF. So let's fix that and see if it helps Ole, before we sack him.
Completely agreed with everything you said
I agree we don't have those players to create magic but the current coaching team are clearly failing to develop an attacking style on the players we do have also. No movement or gameplan to be seen in the attacking third game after game side from getting in behind high lines.
The 11 players that walked on that pitch were more than enough to beat Burnley with some basic tactics and mentality. Which squad do you think Dice would prefer?
Perhaps.....\n\nControversial take: I think we've been improving tactically given the squad, yesterday chances were created, we could've been up by two for sure before they scored. And then they got a goal from a set piece(their biggest strength vs our biggest weakness) and then defend with 11 men. Overlapping runs being made by Williams/James but Andreas not linking up with the runs ever and passing back and forth to Fred/Matic(they suck at offensive football although Fred has been improving as overall) but that's not the type of player that they are. We don't have an offensive/creative midfield (See: Woodward's transfer window masterclasses) so the burden is placed on the wrong players for the job.\nCrosses being sent in to the box, we had a lot of bodies in there this game but after they scored they congested it too much for us. Martial missing two sitters doesn't help our cause at all. We should've been up before they even scored. And if it was 2-1 in our favour they can't defend with 11 men and we have a more open game and probably a different result. I feel like, outside the final third, tactics have been nailed, however if you have no one that is willing/able to make passes that cut defenses open, I don't know what more you want expect besides the manager (whoever that is) to be out there and playing himself.
My main criticism of Ole so far is his insistence on playing Andreas although Andreas has been playing really bad for many games now. In my opinion, one of the biggest factor of our bad season so far is that we have no functioning 10.\n\nAndreas played well, what, 3- 4 games out of 25+ starts(?) That's just not good enough. Lingard got slammed for not scoring/assisting, but somehow Andreas keeps on getting picked game after game, even after he had awful games.\n\nMeanwhile, Mata only ever got his chance just recently, Greenwood is left on the bench constantly even if he plays much better starting from the get go (I think he scores majority of his goals when he starts?). Gomes never got looked at at all.\n\nI know we have injuries so Andreas might be only getting games because we don't have anyone else, but even before these injuries, he (and Lingard) kept on playing and playing, to low to zero effect.\n\nAs a manager, Ole should be able to come up with a new setup to fix our non-existent 10. I don't know, playing 2 strikers by starting Greenwood, drop Andreas for literally anyone else and see how it goes, really anything. At this point, why the hell not try anything else?
No worries we\u2019re all a little upset, fuck Woodward!
what? His Porto attackers were experienced? at a CL level? you\u2019re talking mad shit
Graham Potter and Chris Wilder have worse squads than us playing more attacking football than us. Do you even watch anyone else outside of us?
Poch has done pretty well
Ok but what if he gets a niggle or an injury? We will have 0 strikers left as an option from the bench. Martial and Greenwood cannot start games together because we cannot afford to lose possibly both in a single game. With Rashford out, we have to manage them carefully. We desperately need to add some options upfront and in the midfield.
And what happens if Martial gets an injury? Same situation happens. This is a ridiculously bad take, sorry. Pereira is more likely to get injured than Mason anyway considering he never gets a rest
THEY DON'T PLAY THE SAME POSITION. \n\nStop being daft. Do you really want three forwards when we can't create for shit from midfield?
Pereira started through the middle with Mata on the right, put Mata who\u2019s been our most creative outlet recently through the middle and Mason out wide. Pereira offers fucking nothing, an out of position Greenwood is a much better option.
'Breaking at pace' doesn't work against teams that sit back and deny you space. Ole hasn't worked out how to break them down because he isn't a good enough manager. He has shown he does not know how to adapt. Of all the managers post-Fergie, Ole is the worst of them (in terms of prior achievements and results while at the club), to me he doesn't deserve the time the others weren't afforded. \n\nWhy would you not prefer Poch to come in and give him the backing instead? It's not like the players are going to be bamboozled because suddenly they're not playing on the break. I'd back him to be able to implement a style of play much more than Ole.
>  hasn't worked out how to break them down because he isn't a good enough manager. \n\nWell, we'll have to agree to disagree about this one. I don't think we'd even be having this discussion if they'd bought Bruno in the close season, and Pogba stayed fit. It's not Ole's fault we don't have a creative playmaker. (Mata yes, but he's just not got the legs any more).\n\n> Why would you not prefer Poch to come in and give him the backing instead?

Also, I'm really antsy about a manager who ended up losing the dressing room.
All I can wish is the best of lucky to your lot, mate. I love our league and how competitive, great and unpredictable our games and teams may be. by far, this is the best answer and you gave me a lot of context. much obliged!
Thanks a lot, I wish the same to you (although not on the account of our club, sorry about that). Prem is really great about the way you can't really expect anything and so I hope we will be in the title race with you once again in a few season. You're very welcome, I was glad to share some of this info.
Then when? I disagree with the notion that our team is adequate enough to compete in the premiership and that all of our summer arrivals are say a year too late. Are the decisions makers at our club blind to the fact that our team is basically brought down due to over playing and that this winter transfer window was a perfect time to signal to us fans, Ole and the team that they care and want us to succeed.
\u201cHence giving him another window to get replacements in\u201d\n\n\nThat means giving him till this summer window. 2 summer windows is enough time to rebuild the bulk of a squad. A total rebuild does not happen in one window.
Pereria is actually a better crosser, with more completed crosses per 90 on average believe it or not. Pereira also makes more key passes per 90 (1.3 to James 1) and more accurate long balls (1.4 to James 0.4). The negative aspects to Pereira's game have been highlighted, and his lack of assists and goals has made him appear worse but he's more precise with the ball than James in these specific skillsets. My source, whoscored and Squawka
I don't think statistics tell the full story. I would personally be more comfortable seeing James crossing in comparison to Andreas. What I hate about Andreas is how incredibly wasteful he is. Yes, he is bound to make something occasionally right, but he mostly does it wrong. James isn't as impactful on the pitch and he sometimes seems a bit invisible but just remember that he created our goal in the 1:1 against Liverpool by the perfect cross. There was also that great long pass against Norwich. When I compare those two, Andreas has the ball in his feet much more often and because of the Ole wants us to set up, he is in crossing positions much more often. However, I think James has hiqher quality in the final ball, believe it or not. He just doesn't get into those positions enough and doesn't have the ball as much as Pereira. With that said, James should be a squad player and Pereira should be a reserve player based on the way he plays now.
Naive. If hiring a top manager is showing intent then why are we in the position we're in. LVG and Mourinho are huge draws in the world of management yet we're still here.\n\nSigning big names isn't the only way we find our way back. Don't like to reference them but Salah, Mane nor Firmino were incredibly sought after talents when signed. Recruitment at this club is a shambles and it has been for a long time, manager reputation isn't changing that. You're a short term fixer and honestly the ideal fan for the current ownership of the club.\n\nIn what possible world does grammar give you any standing in the argument. I'm on my phone in bed and you think the fact I'm not proof reading a Reddit comment gives you any form of higher ground, the fuck is wrong with you.\n\nIn no way at all did you respond to any points.\n\nRegardless it's irrelevant to attempt discussions with someone's who's got a superiority complex.\n\nYou've just read that I don't think Ole is a quality manager yet still proceeded to create your own narrative on what I believe is his or the players fault.\n\nGonna assume you're angry and looking for an argument but honestly I'm wasting my time.\n\nI wholeheartedly disagree with how you'd proceed with the club but crack on lad, you're entitled to your opinion.
I'm sorry dude, but the things you write don't logically follow. Having the intent to improve doesn't mean you are going to improve. It's an intention. Hiring LvG and Mourinho were examples of that. That it didn't work out doesn't mean there wasn't that intention. \n\nIt just doesn't logically follow. I don't know what to tell you. If I do the dishes, it shows the intent that I want things to be clean. But that doesn't automatically mean my house is clean if I don't do anything else but wash the dishes. I would still have to wash my clothes and vacuum clean. \n\nI can already tell you're going to be confused by the analogy, though. Like, nothing you wrote follows in a logical way.
A better manager would still get more out of this team. Could at least learn how to defend a set piece or score off of one. Simple things that change games.
Yeah that is so true. We made two huge mistake during the summer that has cost us so many points. Not replacing Lukaku and not getting a creative midfielder. I will always wonder how the season would have looked with a competent midfielder like Bruno for the whole season.
I mean if we hadn't screwed up Pogba's season we'd be a tonne better off than we are right now. It's been a season of mistakes so far and unless someone takes us by the scruff of the neck and drags us we're not going to finish well. \n\nI mean at this point even just a couple of players on loan just to see us through the season would be a bloody miracle. i just hope we don't get too many more injuries.
I'd be interested to know what you think the style of play is. I personally cannot see it; I think it's very much letting the players figure it out themselves.
High press is an obvious one and a great example of idea let down by execution. We have the energy but not the coordination, we don't press in packs enough and if you look at how top teams press they are brilliant at cutting all possible passing options. We aren't there yet, sometimes we force teams wide quite effectively but often we just leave one passing lane open that players with good composure and technique can take advantage of. It's far too often a one man press with the others reacting quite slowly to join. Again I think squad depth and tired legs play a role, to be fair. \n\nPositional fluidity from the front players. \n\nObviously rash and martial switch a lot but our whole front four swap positions, often changing when we reset our shape after pressing (e.g Pereira often ends up at striker when a move resets because he leads the press a lot). \n\nAgain, execution could be better in possession. I like  positional fluidity as it can lead to more dynamic movement and pull defences apart, but at the moment we don't see it happen enough mid-play. Usually whoever is on the left out of rash and martial when maguire picks up the ball is still the one on the left when the move ends. I want to see more stuff like martial's goal vs chelsea, where he drops from central space then overlaps on the left so that Marcus can drive diagonally. Or martial's chance vs burnley where mata made a run to the middle from his RW starting point, shifting the defence and then letting a pass run through to martial, confusing the defence. Or something where when martial drops deep and lays it off, the midfielder immediately pings it into rashford who is running into the vacated space. At the moment most of the position swapping happens in between plays. \n\nThe big one imo is high tempo, and being direct. Whether we are countering or dominating possession we try to be direct, and move the ball forward with tempo. However, we aren't good enough at midfield buildup to consistently progress up the pitch at pace and so moves stagnate, leading to us running out of ideas. You can see that ole tries to make us play at a tempo, but our failure to sustain any kind of intensity or authority in possession means that everything else just falls apart. Sometimes - like norwich and partizan at home - we see what the template is, but I think the main reason we are good on the counter is that it allows us the space to maintain tempo, players don't hesitate on the ball as much when there's more space to attack, and the positional movement of the forwards is easier to pull off - e.g. aforementioned martial goal vs chelsea and also mata vs wolves to an extent. Ole's philosophy is all about playing with tempo but the team aren't confident enough in possession to actually achieve that high tempo, and that impacts evry other aspect of our tactics. The thing that made me hopeful about the burnley game was that in the first half our we clearly saw a plan B for when a move loses its momentum and we moved to a more structured build up aimed at releasing AWB in the final third. Being braver with our full backs is something we need to see more of if we are going to be successful as well.
At leeds so the nightlife has got the better of me so far \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 and yeah i thought that but todays exam couldve been a fail which is mad because on all the past papers i did i got 80+%. \n\n\nStill getting to terms with how much more proofs and understanding of theorms you need rather than just applying them
Oooo nice that was my second choice! Great city!\n\n> exam couldve been a fail which is mad because on all the past papers i did i got 80+%. \n\nIt will be moderated dw about it. They'll bump up your mark if everyone did poorly.\n\n>Still getting to terms with how much more proofs and understanding of theorms you need rather than just applying them\n\nLearn the definitions...you'll thank me later.\n\nHelps with proofs and also racks up the odd few marks!
We will end up 6-10 if we play at our best may be 10-14 if we perform little worse. \nA much better season under Moyes, van gal and Jose got them fired let\u2019s see what happens.
I can get behind that, I prefer Lingard to Andreas honestly, at least his passing and off the ball movement is more crisp. Mata's engine needs taking care of, he will get injured very quickly if he starts multiple games in a row like Rio under Moyes. And yes, but maybe this is the best thing that's worked so far? We don't get to see practices. Although this is the time if there ever was one to experiment lol.
You missed my point. We literally have only 2 players who can play as the CF. If Pereira gets injured, we possibly could play Lingard/Mata/Gomes in that position. We have 0 recognised strikers apart from Martial and Greenwood.
\n>Well, we'll have to agree to disagree about this one. I don't think we'd even be having this discussion if they'd bought Bruno in the close season, and Pogba stayed fit. It's not Ole's fault we don't have a creative playmaker. (Mata yes, but he's just not got the legs any more).\n\nYou shouldn't need these players to beat Burnley at home. Forgetting this game, too often we've been devoid of any semblance of inspiration and that's down to the manager for me.\n\n>a) because Poch would want control over transfers, and the Spurs fans I've seen talk about this stuff say he's not actually that good at it. Apparently the Spurs problems started when Paul Mitchel left and transfers devolved to Poch.\n\nThe problems started because Levy wouldn't spend anything and both Poch and his players got frustrated at nothing changing.\n\n>b) because Poch would want a different style of players again, so we'd have to change strategy once more.\n\nBut his style is so much better than Ole's, Ole  hasn't even shown he has a style except counter vs teams that ket you.\n\n>c) it's covering up the real problem. I can't judge Ole properly because the board have let him down so badly. So they should fix that first.\n\nObviously Woodward and the Glazers are a massive problem. But they're not going anywhere, lets be real. \n\n>d) I actually don't think Poch is good enough. He's never won anything. All those years at Spurs with players like Kane and Son - and he couldn't drag them over the line for one league cup? Also, I'm really antsy about a manager who ended up losing the dressing room.\n\nThis one I think it is mental. Spurs pre-Poch were bang average. He turned them into a consistent (key word) top 4 side with a budget dwarfed by his rivals. Imagine saying Spurs would be a consistent Champions League level team (and even reach a final) the season after Bale left. The trophy argument is a terrible's one, he massively overachieved with Spurs and improved so many players. He would have won trophies if they had our spending power. Ole has done nothing to show he's remotely close to the level Poch is.
A lot of clubs up and down the table and across Europe are taking the opportunity of the January transfer window to address the issues of their club but ours hasn't. And you want to wait? Look I get the sentiment that Ole is our living legend from Camp Nou from 1999 but for fuck sakes tell me what has he or his backroom done to improve us as a team? Are we taking advantage of the attacking runs that he is encouraging? Are there some specialist in free kicks or corner kicks that are making the most of those runs? Do we even have a formation if and when more of our team gets injured. But you are right this is clearly not the time and place to improve our standing in the EPL. When we fall off the top 6 or 10 I'm sure proper footballers and sponsors would be lining up to join us next season as opposed to joining Leicester, Spurs or Wolverhampton; where the teams are properly managed and have a clear vision of where they want to be. After all we are in a middle of a reboot right? The deadwoods stuck with us will also magically want to leave us after this right and their optimal market values too. Yeah you're right my bad.
Pereira has provided more big chances than James but unfortunately for him other players haven't finished them. The perfect pass he laid on to Williams that the kid blasted over recently springs to mind. There's also a reason Pereira takes corners, he has real spin on his crosses\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/en9crx/brandon_williams_horrible_miss_vs_norwich/
I know he sometimes manage to do a thing right and I know he has the technique, he just rarely ever uses it well because of his decisions. James has much better decision making (nothing stellar, but still) in my opinion, he just goes missing a lot while Andreas doesn't. The main frustration from Andreas comes because of how many situations he bottles with a bad pass or a bad shot. He gets into those situations and dangerous situations a lot, but rarely ever something comes out of it. Yes, he usually does one or maybe two things right in a match, but there is another 8 or so similar situations he absolutely bottles. That's why he frustrates me so much. I know what he is capable of, but the way he does things is very similar to Cavani. Whenever I watched Cavani, he created 10 chances all by himself and missed 8-9 of them. This is a similar principle, but Andreas messes up with easy stuff.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I remember how he set up Martial against Liverpool, I remember how he set up Brandon in this video. But there is always much more chances like these, even easier chances for him, but he still messes them up, which is something you don't want from from your No. 10. James's contributions seem generally better, because he has in my opinion less chances but better final product. On the other he has been playing a lot this season and he should get some rest, since lately he hasn't been the best, which is something you expect from a 20 years old kid who just came in from the Championship
It's not an exam, it doesn't need too. \n\nBut I absolutely understand you. I just disagree. I don't think our issue is our ability to draw players in.\n\nI'm in no way disagreeing that having Ole in charge in comparison to Poch for example is more appealing to a footballer. You would rather play under Poch, I get that.\n\nSo signing Poch, is showing intent from the board. You're correct. But that's honestly as far as I see it going. If this player A is excited to come play for a Poch run United team, Woodward still handles the transfer, and my point is I still see an entire window of negotiating, haggling, wasting time that could otherwise be spent on other targets only to miss out or overpay.\n\nNever contested that Ole may not be the man for the job, I just maintain that I don't think it makes much difference at all. We've been mismanaged from day dot. \n\nI think until there is change in how we approach recruitment we're stuck in a constant cycle.
Ahh didnt know it was moderated thought it was like set percentages!? \n\n\nAnd yeah the proofs just went over my head completely and i thought id be fine to just remember the formulas rather than understand them which was a big mistake haha
Yeah man, they can't have everyone do under par.\n\nIn summer of my first year they bumped us all up 10 marks from Jan and  May structures (proof) exam because we all fucked it lol
I can only hope \ud83d\ude2d hope you smash your last year mate!
Penultimate ;) Masters for me!\n\nBest of luck in your exam and first year!
We can't break down defenses; we can't counterattack as opponents have learned our rhythm now (City and Pool). I don't even know what we can do. \n\nThis Burnley team was actually horrendous; they couldn't string three passes together yet managed to win comfortably.
Our culture is reboot. Why so negative?
Fuck that was probably the worst timing for a post like that haha
5 year with minimal gain ismt doing alright to be honest
And they say people can't support a financial group.
Sad but true
It isn\u2019t, it\u2019s on a downward trend overall despite short term upticks.
Rotation decisions? I agree maybe Greenwood should\u2019ve started but otherwise who? Rotate who with who?
It's about which game/ competition to use which players. He cared too much about Carabao and FA cup, which led to the problems today.
Why rotate when you can play Jones and lingers instead.
Use heavily rotated squads for both Carabao and FA cups! Literally no one cares about Carabao cup.\n\nWe need to prioritize - Ole knows better than anyone how thin our squad is.
Everyone is to blame to be fair but mainly the board and Ed Woodward. OLE can't rotate what we don't have but now it's finally catching up to us.
Ole cared too much about Carabao cup/ FA cup which I can't get behind. He gives out strongest teams for every game & competition.
>Ole is also part of the problem for extremely poor rotation decisions leading to fatigues and injuries.\n\nHe's a bigger problem than that. This guy is a managerial shambles. There's not one Prem or Championship club that would take him over their current manager. And we've actually got fans still backing him!\n\nYes Ole thank you for sticking your leg out 21 years ago but you're shit please fuck off.
This comment makes me sad.
He'd at least win a couple of headers against Mee and the likes.
80 mins, my phone battery down to 25%. I decided to save what little power I have
This is the defeatist attitude of the modern Man Utd fan. Ole is shit, so are the owners. You can't just excuse how badly we play every week because we don't sign anyone. Sean Dyche has come with a gameplan and done us over because he knows how to manage a team. Ole is clueless and there is no fucking way any decent manager would lose 2-0 to that Burnley side if they knew what tactics were. Fuck the Glazers but i'm not going to excuse the fact that OLE IS SHIT.\n\nEdit: Also, Ole is a yes man and he has shown himself as a fucking yes man when he backs down every press conference when asked a difficult question. He will enable Woodward and we will get worse.
I completely agree. Managing isn't just about receiving new signings and selecting the team. Any random off the street could do that\n\nIts also about coaching and tactics. We are the literal worst team in the league in defending set pieces, *after* signing 2 defenders for 130m and breaking the record for a CB
Spot on. People want one nice easy thing to blame whether that\u2019s Ole, Ed or the players, realistically it\u2019s a mix of all of them. Just cause Ed is an idiot doesn\u2019t mean Ole\u2019s been good enough
Thank you. \n\nSoton is playing well in at least a few game. Leicester have built an amazing team outta nothing with one season of Rodgers. \n\nAnd we are still plodding along doing zilch.
Bang on mate. Hopefully more people start to understand this
\"no fucking way any decent manager would lose 2-0 to that Burnley side\"\n\nThis is not me defending Ole at all as I agree with the sentiment...but haven't our last 3 managers, all of whom were at minimum \"decent\" managers, lost these types of games over and over again? Moyes, LVG and Mourinho all had trouble winning games like this to varying degrees. Why?\n\nSacking the manager seems to be tackling the symptom rather than the problem. I don't know what the answer is but a new manager doesn't ever seem to solve anything.
That\u2019s what managers do.  SAF was also a bowing and scraping apologist for the Glazers (and still is to this day), Poch would be the same.  The alternative is throwing toys out the pram like Conte and Mourinho - it doesn\u2019t work.
But the right signings are not available.\n\n/s
[deleted]
So by that means there's a chance of 2 signings in next 4 years? Fk
Think we need more than one personally.
Ed Woodward:\n\n\"One it is!\"
I remember a certain Norway born manager sold our players because youth was enough.\n\nMeanwhile, Lukaku is having fun in Italy.
I would say most Man U fans believed Lukaku should\u2019ve been gone from the team. I\u2019m in that camp too. But I\u2019m also in the camp that believes he should\u2019ve been replaced in the same window.
Could bring on one of our best crossers of the ball for someone who was knackered by the 6th min.
And bring on whom.\n\nThis squad (after injuries and all) isn't good enough for top 4.
Not in the mood to argue mate. Just absolutely fucked off. If you think Ole has an excuse for barely registering a decent shot at home against Burnley then fair fucks. \n\nI just don\u2019t agree and you\u2019ll not convince me his strategy almost worked there. There\u2019s always an excuse for what he\u2019s done. I don\u2019t care anymore.
- the best he can\n- what he has\n\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t believe either are good enough.
> Ole is doing\n\nnothing.\n\nEvery team with shit players are beating us.
That\u2019s what playing 3 matches a week while also injured looks like
Maguire won almost every header he competed for, Jones was good but was being bullied by their strikers in the air
We've just worn him down to our level lol
Do you honestly think Maguire is a PL winning CB? A leader? The backbone of a new United era? \n\nThat\u2019s what he was brought into be, at the moment he is none of those things and it\u2019s sad people just won\u2019t face it, probably it would seem even sadder to have spent 80m on a flop. \n\nHis performance today was not only lacking in quality, but as a captain he was just not there, no passion, no anger, just another player with his head hanging down.
If Cahill, Stones, Otamendi, Huth and Lescott were PL winning CBs, Maguire can be too. The way he was rushed in back from injury to play every 90 minutes is telling, I wouldn't be surprised at all if he's still playing with painkillers.
Super reactionary take. No way he's worse of a signing than Falcao, di Maria, Memphis, Mkhitaryan, Bailly, Rojo, etc
They didnt cost \u00a385m
Glad one of our players has injured himself? Off you fuck. Bloody plastics
Jones not being able to play>>>>>> possibility of jones playing
the only reason Ole is still at the wheel is becasue ex United player , now pundits back him , \n\nThe Chairman just dont want to invest
Half that euro league squad isnt even here anymore and alot of that squad was brought in by lvg.
Well, no. He won the Europa League with Zlatan, Pogba, Valencia, Smalling, Rojo, Herrera, Fellaini, etc. Those guys aren\u2019t playing for us right now.
Mkhitaryan was really good in that run too
Given how thin the squad is and still will be next season I\u2019m not so sure that would be a bad thing

Maybe wait until you get your PhD
Defer a few years
Then travel the world, visit every country.
Haha. Same here man. I\u2019ve been dying to go watch a game live and not having to wake up early morning on a Saturday or a Sunday to watch a game. But at this rate, I\u2019d rather sleep it off than to fly across the Atlantic to watch this shit
I was actually thinking this today. I live in the US and have been dying to go with my gf to the point that we almost bought the flights a couple weeks ago. I told her we should hold off because I honestly don\u2019t see myself paying thousands of dollars and enjoying the experience if theres even a small chance we play like this. Total bummer
The first time there has been a positive to failing your exams.
At least we scored then...
It wasn't even as half as pathetic
I meant more the 'wait your whole life to save up and travel across the world to watch your favourite team play at home, and they lose pathetically in a game they're supposed to win'
Yeah, you\u2019re probably right. I don\u2019t know why. Poor sir alex is going to pass away with the club in shambles. Poor guy.
I could never see SAF doing it in public. He may be voicing his opinion internally but we have no idea what his influence is now.
Not much influence probably. But if he came out and said that he supports the fans, that would just be a massive pile on. \n\nHowever, I am sure as he left, they gave him a good package and another NDA so he can't say anything ever.
The Glazers don\u2019t care, we turn a hearty profit and they are wringing us dry and burying us into the fucking ground.\n\nThey boil my piss.
Its fucked up how heartless they are. Like if I bought something, like a car for example, and I\u2019m using it to Uber. I\u2019ll take care of my car like its the most precious thing. I\u2019ll change the oil when I need to. I\u2019ll buy new tires when I see that the current ones are showing some wear and tear. I\u2019ll make sure the seats are in good condition and that it smells good especially for the customers. Doing all that and making money using it I mean do they care about the club? In the state that its in? Do they know that we are currently the laughing stock of the premier league?? Its just embarrassing and Rio couldnt have said it any better
Herrera? And of course people will criticize bad performances, doesn\u2019t mean you get rid of them without replacing them.
Of course they\u2019re not superstars. \n\nBut you can\u2019t tell me selling your top goal scorer, a decent CM in Hererra and someone who offers a different tactic in Fellaini isn\u2019t going to impact squad depth.\n\nWe are threadbare, in quality, tactics and numbers.
Sometimes I feel like Ole is just quick selling everyone on Ultimate team for 200 coins. Embarrassing how a premier leagus club is run like this
Smalling wanted to start every match, nothing Ole could do about it
This guy maths
6th? Please, we are 4 points off 14th...
tbh anything could happen this year. this season has been wildly, wildly unpredictable as far as results. Only City, Liverpool, and Norwich have cemented their places lol.
This reality is so fucked.
And 6 off 4th
That's unbelievable but true. The league is just bizarre this year.   Everybody club outside Liverpool are either massively overperforming or underperforming.
Rancid performances against bottom half teams was the preserve of away games, now its seeping into Old Trafford - wouldnt be so sure
I've been saying since October United are on course for a 9th to 12th place finish this season\n I am sticking with that.
And funny thing is all it took was a couple decent signings and a good manager to get the most out of his players. It's not like Klopp broke the bank with this team. Klopp said when he left Dortmund he wanted a project. Liverpool was a massive project but he's built them into a dynasty. \n\nIs interesting comparing what United have done vs Liverpool during the Klopp era
Yeah but it took 30 years mate so it's not as simple as oh yeah they just got a good mananger and then good signings otherwise everyone would do it wouldn't they
I just don\u2019t understand how anyone thinks that our weak ass shallow squad would survive Poch\u2019s system... our squad can\u2019t stay healthy or rested and these people want to bring in arguably the most grueling system the Prem has seen in recent years... pure ridiculousness.
You must be deluded if you think sabotaging the team for a \"long-term vision\" makes any sense
Outgoings:\n\nLukaku\nShort term bad: because we didn\u2019t replace him. \n\nLong term good: didn\u2019t want to be here, likely to be a negative influence on other team members because of this.\n\nHerrera:\nShort term bad: didn\u2019t replace him. \n\nLong term good: wanted \u00a3300k wages or whatever for 5 years when he\u2019s already about to hit 30. Not a good deal.\n\nSanchez:\nShort term bad: well none really, all wanted him gone and off the wage bill\n\nLong term good: again, none really, we need him off the wage bill.\n\nSmalling\n\nShort term bad: now we see him playing well again, we need him back\n\nLong term good: now he\u2019s been away, he\u2019s found form again, he\u2019d be great right now but he needed to get away to find that form. I wish Jones could do the same.\n\nIn:\n\nMaguire:\n\nShort term bad: not started as well as he should. Not looking like the player we bought.\n\nLong term good: should be a long term captain of this club if he starts performing. Good age for the role.\n\nJames:\n\nShort term bad: asked him to step up to the prem and outperform others. He started well but has been unable to keep that up. Thrown in the deep end.\n\nLong term good:\n\nYoung, type of player we want at this club. Just needed more time.\n\nAWB\n\nShort term bad: none, been great. Need to develop his attacking contributions \n\nLong term good: he\u2019ll grow into the attacking game and become a monster.
Long term based on what? Our current transfer trajectory has us with no squad left in the long term..
See post below
This game has shown that greenwood is not a winger, if he plays centrally he has better chance if impacting the game, like most of the goals he's scored centrally and outside the box
Yeah I was right near the front but expected it to be dead. But was great to see them stand up and chant stand up if you hate glazers although some just stood and clapped confused but better than nothing lol.\n\nStretford end is the dream, a mates moving abroad so might be giving it to me next season. Let's bloody hope we have some of our shit together by then
Oh I agree man, I don\u2019t expect any changes above Ole at all. My point was it\u2019s irritating listening to the ex-players trying to show us \u2018look I\u2019m angry too\u2019 when they are shit scared of naming Ed and the Glazers outright as the main culprits in this situation.
*Pret-A-Manager becomes the official United brunch sponsor*
That would be a massive coop for Ed and our team, hopefully it happens. Who needs Bruno or anyone with legs when you have some good sandwiches to eat.
Do you go to watch FC United play?
Bruh the stadium I've never seen so empty on the telly before.
Only because it\u2019s a Tuesday, weekends it\u2019ll be packed again
Was a really late kick off on a week night
The problem is that\u2019s maybe 25% of the investment the squad needs.
Lingard and Periera won't improve. They are limited players. Lingard is known for his movement and work rate, yet he plays as a number 10 and cant control the ball, has no eye for a pass to unlock defences and is only decent in a counter attacking system. He doesn't belong in a team that aims for top 4. He scored one goal in the europa league. A whole year and that is what he has given us? It's a joke. Greenwood deserves to get starts the same way Williams has earned his starts, especially when Mata is forced to play on the right because our manager would rather play Pereira. I get that we dont have squad depth and we have a lot of deadwood but that is no excuse for playing bad players and not giving young, hungry and apparently fearless players a chance.
Couldn\u2019t have said it better myself.
Called the recruitment shit. Then said results prove Ole not doing a good job.
He won't be champions league contenders all of a sudden but at least it will be a big step towards rebuilding
At least get it right if you're going to bring his achievements as manager into the picture. He won two league titles and a domestic cup with Molde.
Idk man, its like I'm watching Robben the past few games, when the season started he was actually very unpredictable
I agree with you. He is left footed. I've just seen him use his right well enough to know how good it is but he's definitely left footed and has been favouring it a lot recently
It's fucking sad man. It really is. You're not wrong.
We've become the new mid-table team.
Exactly. Pointless wasting our time with all this Woodward needs to go bollocks. You really think the man that brings in big money that lines their pockets is going to get sacked? Not a chance.
I would\u2019ve agree with you a few months ago but it\u2019s become more clear recently that Ole and the board aren\u2019t seeing eye to eye
Ole is a yes man.\n\nSeeing eye to eye? As if Ole has every been anything but a puppet.
We\u2019re without 3 of our best players and the board aren\u2019t making any signings. Ole may not be the man for the job but nobody really is. With ownership like we have, there\u2019s just no way to succeed regardless of who the manager is. \n\nJose was right, he pulled off the impossible by finishing 2nd with us
Agree. But what a lot of fans don\u2019t realize is that Ole is a symptom of the clubs ills. No competent board would have hired him and allowed our standards to drop this much. Hence I want all of this BS fixed - fire Woodward or get a DOF in, and then clean out the roster with both the manager and deadwood players we have!
Milan with money *for now.\n\nOnce the results dry up - as they continue to do - do you really think top-tier sponsors will be tripping over each other to throw money at the club?
Yes, because sponsors don't care about results, they care about brand recognition and visibility. Manchester United is one of the most supported clubs in the whole world, which is a huge asset much more important for sponsors than results. Liverpool had basically no results bar a CL win for for decades before Klopp came along, and they had zero trouble getting sponsorships.
We've had 4 managers perform poorly at our club since fergie left. This isn't down entirely to management on the field.
Of course it is not. The chimpanzee at the top is what its all about, sadly. But he staying and we can do fuck all about it. Thats the facts here. So our options is very limited tbh.
You're essentially saying \"if the best manager in world football ever\"..... Bit of an unfair comparison even to the likes of Klopp and Guardiola, let alone Solskjaer who is still learning the trade.
Still learning the trade 10 years into his management career lol
He\u2019s been a manager for years. He\u2019s just shit at it.
You're delusional if you think SAF could've stepped in today and steamrolled Burnley with this XI. I'm not advocating for Ole being a great manager but I don't see what he could have done differently.
??????????\n\nIf SAF had that team at his disposal we would easily beat Burnley. Listen to yourselves ffs. If SAF had DDG, AWB, Martial, Maguire, Jones (a player who he brought in), Williams, Dan James and Mata he'd make this an easy 2-0 win. He's had worse players and beaten better clubs.
SAF definitely could have done that
What are you smoking? Did you see the squad SAF last won the league with?
https://www.balls.ie/football/man-united-vs-arsenal-fa-cup-2011-360756
I simply can\u2019t comprehend the fact people actually defend him. Structure is one thing but to me ole being manager is the most egregious thing Ed and the board has done
Same with Lampard who has come in and shown to be flexible and play with an actual game plan.
We still can't defend set pieces
He has stepped up for a part of the season
Yep also Martial will be one injury away and Greenwood will be run to the ground soon.
AWB looks exhausted as well, may need to call Irwin or one of the Neville brothers.
Fucking hell, looking like a proper team alright
[removed]
So we were shit coached by LVG and Jose as well? These problems have been around for multiple managers. What is the common denominator?
After today, I really should've. Had a damn stressful day.
Lol like I was making a threat. Gtfo
Actually I didn\u2019t scroll the thread. I pretty much knew what was going to be discussed so I just opened it, wrote my comment, and closed it :-)
ah f, so i am the only one who scroll to bottom this thread to find something good? stats looks good, so i think ones will appreciated it, but turn out it seems stats didn't tell the match correctly.  \n\ni missed this match, and now i am not regret it.
Yeah this season has been terrible, 5th and 14th are only  5 points apart
Not true, here is the average points per position since PL began v this year.\n\n Avg 1995-18/19 | Current 19/20  \n1) 51 | 61  \n2) 45 | 48  \n3) 43 | 45  \n4) 40 | 39  \n5) 38 | 34  \n6) 36 | 34
You'd only include an average that includes results from the 90s to deliberately skew your numbers using a time when \\~80 pretty much guaranteed you the title.\n\nHow about we look at the most recent years in the PL, and see what 40 points (4th place) and 34 points (5th) would put you after GW 24 (assuming better GD in case of ties):\n\n2018/19: 7th, 9th\n\n2017/18: 7th, 8th\n\n2016/17: 7th, 9th\n\n2015/16: 5th, 8th\n\n2014/15: 7th, 10th\n\n2013/14: 7th, 11th\n\n2012/13: 6th, 9th\n\n2011/12: 7th, 10th\n\n2010/11: 7th, 10th\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis season the 3 best teams are still very good, but the rest of the league is mired in mediocrity including 4 of the 'big 6', and a couple of small clubs (wolves, sheffield) have real shots at EL spots in their place.
Yes and no. There\u2019s lots at play here. Not just, oh we\u2019re struggling and still 5th therefore leagues shit. \n\nIt\u2019s more complicated than that.
I didnt say that at all, i said the whole league is struggling this year outside the top 3.  Chelsea\u2019s 40 points would have them in 7th place last season at this point, 5 points off of 6th.\n\nInstead they are in 4th, 6 points clear of 5th.  Outside liverpool and city, the rest of the \u2018top 6\u2019 are historically bad (for them) this year collectively.  Taking solace in being 5th in this league is trash, and oh yeah, we are 30 points off first.  Thats pathetic, hands down
Well, Liverpool are basically getting a free run right now. IMo they even looked a lot more dominant last season than this one, they've gotten their fair share of average performance and clutch wins. On top of that, Spurs and Arsenal, both, sacked their own managers this very season, City lost their best defender (Laporte) with an injury while one of their key players (Fernandinho) is starting to decline. Chelsea are off from losing their best player, they lost their world class manager and brought in a legit rookie to replace him and were banned from signing anyone in the summer. Their January signing they made to kinda cope with Hazard leaving has been injured for a while too. Only Leicester City have been able to keep up with some sort of consistency and they finished beneath midtable last season. It's just been a bad season for the top 4 race all around.
> All of this is true and can all be true at the same time.\n\nA concept good chunk of our fans just can't seem to comprehend.
The *cultural reboot* thread worked as this sub in a nutshell, though. Some positivity, although plenty didn't agree with his overall point, I certainty didn't. Then comes another loss and the inevitable reactions. Went from having a good amount of upvotes to getting locked within minutes of the final whistle.\n\nIn terms of what u/justalostcoder mentioned in terms of discussing tactics and philosophy; that's something people on this sub has done through all of this. It's no coincidence that nearly every commentator and expert, across nearly all our matches, on different networks, keep bringing up the topic of our lack of movement and creativity when we're not on the counter. It's been every match and it's been discussed, from what I've seen and participated in, in some detail in most post-match threads and the like. \n\nAs fans, we've got plenty of reasons to be negative based on everything that's going on with this club we hold so dear but how that negatively takes shape is important. The same goes for the positivity in this sub as well. After the Liverpool game, people lifted Fred into the sky, and well deserved for that performance. However, there's also people who suddenly come in and start pulling positivity out of thin air, like the Lingard hockey assist thread or the eventual xG threads which nearly became a meme. \n\nI'm rambling on a bit here but my main point is that this sub is far from perfect and going to stay that way as long as this continues. People are fed up and frustrated, and some people don't channel that in the best ways. That manifests itself in some people attacking others for the wrong reasons, people literally saying they're giving up the club etc. \n\nWhen it comes to counter attacking football, u/juurdd, the main issue is that we're currently a side that can often sit with 50-70% but with no effective system in combination with lackluster players in central roles, to break teams down. Plenty of our players run and move like crazy whenever they have 50 yards of space in front of them but are completely static when it comes to moving when play slows down and there's less space to attack. A result like today, as in many other matches, are both on Ole and the quality of the players. We're still not seeing enough development and progress in a lot of the areas where the problems has been nearly constant since the start of the season. When you don't have players you're willing to allow the freedom to do their shit, then you got to coach them. You got to tell them how and where to move in order to open space for other players, and all the rest. That's honestly where Ole, and in effect the rest of the coaching staff, looks completely out of touch.
Well written. Makes me feel bad for not putting in  much effort in my message formats.\n\nTo the discussion though, this sub is reactionary myself included at times but I think its getting to the stage of tipping point between this sub and what we have seen in the stands late in the game.\n\nI do believe Ole is out his depth and as you mentioned the coaching isn't there in terms of movement but why too did LVG and Mourinho fail to succeed. I think Ole is to part blame in this but the problem is higher up and that surely has to be clear at this point when we've gonr through so many managers and purchased marquee players.\n\nHowever, I'm assuming the glazers don't care provided money is coming in and we could all discuss this till the end of time but probably won't see much change other than a new manager by the end of the year.
I can actually see some merit to the cultural reboot post. But let's be honest Ole is not the only problem and he is also not the solution either
More like dreams and reality
Anyone still saying Ole has got the managerial ability to manage this club is an embarrassment.
Reads like a post from r/the_donald lmao
I don't believe OP wrote it. Same person whining yesterday about his shitposts getting removed, and then turns into Shakespeare
He's changed his flair to \"back the manager\" of course lmao
it's still up, wdym?
can you share a link? I can\u2019t find it
Leading to a general apathy towards the club which in turn will lead to a loss of value thus forcing the owners to sell.
Really? On paper our team is miles ahead of Burnley, and that's not even close
Burnley or no Burnley, large parts of our team is not good enough.
True, the pool is destined to have shit because of the parent's incompetence.\n\nHowever, the problem can be lessened by having a kid that can swim and a proper vacuum and sanitation system (good coaches)
Maybe draining the pool, which we are doing, _and then actually putting water back in it._
Youth\n\nCourage\n\nLose 2-0 to Burnley at home
not just someone....somefew
Five or six
>Be patient - it\u2019ll be worth it. Let\u2019s get behind the boys and smash Burnley tonight.\n\nJust need to keep posting it after every failure and change the team... \n\nBe patient - it\u2019ll be worth it. Let\u2019s get behind the boys and smash Man City tonight. \n\nBe patient - it\u2019ll be worth it. Let\u2019s get behind the boys and smash Wolves tonight. \n\nBe patient - it\u2019ll be worth it. Let\u2019s get behind the boys and smash Chelsea tonight.\n\nBe patient - it\u2019ll be worth it. Let\u2019s get behind the boys and smash Club Brugge tonight.
God, give me that mental strength.
Tweeted something very similar to this. The players not mentioned here, including Martial and Pogba, should be sold asap or in the following windows.
McGuire is ok but at 85 price tag i think it's just not worth it. But yes already here so what tha heck
The fact they let Smalling go out on loan but kept Jones as 3rd choice tells you all you need know about poor decisions.
Bro i have a uni exam tomorrow and sacked of the revision to watch whatever that was
Ahh man that's tough.\n\nI know this sub can be split/toxic, but one thing we all do is support our club to the fucking end, no matter what.\n\nBest of luck in your uni exam fella!
Even though they played like shite. Id prefer watching that over studying anyday of the week LOL
Can you give me the gist of it?
Someone posted a ten paragraph diatribe about how weve rebooted united culture. It was a load of wank but plastics upvoted it. Now it's gone thankfully. It was embarrassing.
https://imgur.com/t/roguelike/uPbkRSa
- Vision for the club\n\n- Ability to clear out dead wood\n\n- A decent recruitment record\n\n- Working relationship with club heirarchy\n\n- No one better than him would sign for us as a DOF because of Ed's unwillingness to relinquish power
The jury is still out on Dan James. Could be a great future player, could be a bench warmer we don't know yet.\n\nWan bissaka buy was a no-brainer, mourinho already wanted Maguire and Ole over-paid for him. He isn't worth 80 mill and we should have had more suitable replacement other than Maguire or bust.
Yourr right. But the set piece goals we constantly concede isn't about midfield cover. We are still terrible at defending set pieces. It's the same issue from last season. We binned smalling and bought Maguire yet its the same issue.
I agree with you on that one, we are absolutely terrible at set pieces, both offensively and defensively. It just makes me wonder who actually is our set piece coach, but based on how we struggle with them I suppose we don't have one. We should really change the way we defend set pieces (drop the zone defending and bring in man marking) and we should actually create something from ours, since I haven't seen us create anything from a set piece for a long time (not counting our short set pieces and subsequent crosses, I can only remember one corner when James played low pass to Scott who ran out of nowhere and he missed by a very little, I don't remember what match it was though)
Scott could also have more time to rest.\n\nOle is overusing players in the second-rate tournaments, when our squad is barely capable to produce an adequate starting eleven for the PL.
It's all about the silver linings
I am willing to do anything in reason, I'm at a gap in jobs for the next month and refuse to see us turn into Milan or worse. No one person anywhere is bigger than the club.
Is it worse than Losing 4-0 to MKDons though
I don\u2019t know why we pay so many wages to medical staff.
The players are having a bad season and want to prove to everyone they can do better. The managers having a bad season and needs his best players and so plays them even if they aren't 100%.\nThe club has sold our depth and so we can't rest half the team if we tried. We've failed on so many levels this season it's unreal. \n\nWe need a massive overhaul and the club needs to make an inquiry into why this situation has happened three or four times already this season. Rashford/Pogba/McTominay all on lengthy layoffs due to poor decision making by the club. I reckon Maguire will be the next one, I mean who do we have to take his place?
Ah great so we want to basically end careers of these players. \nWhat is the medical staff fucking doing?
He is playing throught a triple stress fracture a floating dildo in his ankle, half a brain missing in his head and an ACL injury no worries tho he'll get some rest when we have a big enough squad xo
Look man that Cardiff job, even SAF recommended him not to take it. It was set to fail from the beginning. I know Ole does not have enough experience to be incharge of this club, but he is definitely not part of the problem, and I'm not saying that inorder to protect him or anything, rather I would say he was not the correct solution. He had good intentions when he joined the club, got rid of some high wage players, introduced youngsters to the squad, and did his best with what he had. Again, I would say he was set to fail, just like his Cardiff job. Hence I'm not blaming him for this dire season and half under his spell.
Yeah, I get you. I have not anger towards Ole at all (except his management of injuries). It\u2019s not his fault in that sense. He was perfect for the interim role but he should never have been given the full time job. That\u2019s on Woodward, not him.
Tbf he didn't get any real chances. Mostly hopeful shots from outside the box
He was one on one with the keeper in the first half after the mata dummy.\n\n  \n\n\nWan bissaka also set him up with a tap in
I count 2 Clear Cut Chances, inside the Penalty Box.
A squad that needed a serious revamp even in the season it won that title. Fergie knew it but his hands were tied and signed RVP for one last title before leaving. Solskjaer will go down as one of our worst managers
RVP and Rooney were better than our front 4. Still had chitcharito, Evra, Carrick, Rio, DDG
That's the thing.\n\nWe don't have creative players to proof the team can't beat lesser teams.\n\nIf the team gets creative midfielders and same thing keeps going on, then it clearly be Ole's fault.\n\nBut we don't know because there's no Quality players in the midfield(until mctominay and pogba return).\n\nIMO
You don't need Bruno or Maddison to be creative. Obviously they'll take you up a level but you can still be creative without that kind of player. Look at how we move the ball, no intensity, no urgency, nothing. Whenever we get the ball in build up our players take a couple touches forward, see if they can find a pass and inevitably just recycle the ball back to where it came. You need to move the ball quickly, you get taught as a child to make the ball do the work, that the ball moves quicker than you, so if you can move it quickly it opens gaps in the opponents defensive shape for you to exploit. People need to scrap this mentality that we need Pogba or whoever to play delicate little balls to our forwards to be creative, for a lack of a better word it's the most uneducated approach to the game I've ever seen.\n\nNext time we play, watch how long it takes for us to move the ball from the left side of our field to the right side when we run into congestion, then go watch Liverpool, City hell go watch Brighton and how quickly they move the ball from side to side. It's a joke.
I disagree but I'll dwell there with you for a second. \n\nEven in that scenario, stop playing 4231, we don't have a 10 (creative midfielder). Adjust to the hand you've been dealt with the injuries, lack of signings, etc. But he hasn't, he's persisted with the same unsuccessful formation and tactics over and over. Good managers would make in game adjustments nevermind game to game adjustments.
You\u2019ve lost your head son
> Conte did it, and he wasn\u2019t even a Chelsea legend.\n\nAnd how did that help him? Or Chelsea?
He got a massive payout, then moved back to Italy where he continues to manage
The situation at Chelsea was no where near as dire as it is at United now. But anyway, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll help, but it\u2019d be decent to watch the board get shafted in the public domain.
It did prove one thing though, that Conte was right. He's working his magic with Inter with the board arguably backing him.\n\nAnd Chelsea have struggled under Lampard because of lack of signings too.
He won't, he is a coward
Yeah First half we weren't terrible, some nice little passages of play with absolutely no end product, just so wasteful with some really good chances, then the second half we weren't even in the game, absolutely shocking.
Lol this season was always going to be a write off, but for gawds sake are we bad at breaking teams down.
No rotation. If you have no quality on the bench you can either put out a weaker side of players or put out a tired side with better quality.
My point is more that we should be creating more than three chances at home.\n\nI'm also not sure Burnley play much differently at 1-0 down, until maybe the 75th minute when they'd open up.
We usually try avoid crossing and when he does it's desperately pulling back from the byline after going down the outside of his man. Here, we had structured attacks mained at freeing him up with men to aim at in the box for low crosses. It was much more calculated and considered all around, and was paying dividends until the team just kind of imploded.
I remember seeing him making a some crosses in previous games too, but here he was always available. You think that was the plan, to attack with crossing? It looked like it could work first half hour or so.
Yep.
You don\u2019t think Carlo can plot out a plan to beat this world class defence??
I just have a feeling about that game for whatever reason. \n\nMind you United could lose literally every one of those games and I wouldn't be suprised. Obv Carlo is league's above Ole tactically.\n\nOle will undoubtedly surprise everyone by trying to play counter-attacking football /s
Everyone bar McTominay, Herrera, Pogba and Lukaku but Ole still got 150m to spend in the summer.
James, Maguire, Wan-Bissaka, Greenwood, Williams, Pereira didn't start under Mourinho. It's not really the same team.
6.
Based on appearances from that season: De Gea (37), Matic (36), Lingard (33), Martial (30), Mata (28), Jones (23), and Shaw (11). All of those, except Martial and Shaw, was in the top 11 for minutes played, as well.
And he had Zlatan, Pogba, Herrera and Lukaku. Not exactly the same team. But I agree he overachieved.
What does that even mean?
Poch is capable of instilling a player style with bare minimum resources. \n\nHe also doesn\u2019t destroy his players health trying to chase 3 points against almighty Burnley
Instilling some type of attacking philosophy to break teams down is a start
With what creative players?\n\nOur most creative player is Mata ffs
How about not overplaying rash or replacing guys like lukaku and sanch
Ahh sorry I thought you meant this game!
Oh that too, really be careful of what you wish for because you might not be lucky enough to find a suitable replacement in your first try and could be stuck with another season and a half of misery like we did.
I'm okay with any manager tbh, just standing behind the one we've at present. I need to believe that he can deliver, otherwise it's just wasted potential on the field day in day out.
Do you really think Poch would want to come to this? He won\u2019t be promised anything, he\u2019s had enough of cunty chairman\u2019s with Levy not getting players when needed, Woodward is his worst nightmare. He\u2019ll wait out the PSG/Madrid job.
You\u2019re probably right. If the opportunity is there for him, they should go for it. If not, I guess with stick with Ole and see if people\u2019s blind faith is right.
You know what I had completely forgotten about AWB. He has rarely missed a game he has not rest and in some moments in this game I saw him tired and in pain. But dont worry, we have Ashley Young to play in his position. Oh wait...\n\n\nEdit- a word
Thankfully we have a recently returned non match fit Dalot to take over once he does get injured.
Lukaku, Depay, Di Maria, etc. They all fucking did it.\n\nI rate Martial, I really do. He needs service and a little confidence boost imo
Yeah I think service is what he's lacking. There's a very noticeable quality gap in our attacking players. When the ball gets fizzed into Martial he has excellent control, he turns well, all the hallmarks of a quality forward. I think he just finds himself so deep and out of position at times due to our complete lack of creativity. I attribute his poor finishing recently to lack of confidence.
God you're probably right. Not looking forward to pogba's mvkr for that reason.
Martial didn't fail to turn a good chance in to at least a shot on target against Liverpool, or fluff all his chances against Burnley, because of our poor set piece defence.
He can't be too short on cash. Reckon he's got those loaves stacked up
