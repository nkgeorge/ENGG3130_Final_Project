Dirty players, thank god Mike Dean wasn't having none of it.
Fuck Biggie
Add Jon moss, the fat cunt to the list as well.
Where is jon moss?
Getting fucked.
TBF I thought Mike Dean was poor for both sides today. As always.
Probably won't sadly
Couldn't agree more. It's turning into a Hazard situation.
Has to
Yeah, it\u2019s getting absurd. At some point the whole \u201cthey didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d get to the ball!\u201d excise doesn\u2019t cut it.
When you say refs aren\u2019t protecting him do you mean as in they aren\u2019t giving yellows out quick enough for fouls on him? Cheers
Yes. If fouls go unpunished, the ref\u2019s simply enabling another free tactical foul later on that will then take a (later than deserved) yellow, which really isn\u2019t a significant punishment to a defensive team like Burnley that want to break up play and make it a fight.
Yeah at some point you have to put it out there
Lmao
Yeah really not sure why Williams didn't go LM and Shaw LB at the end there
its not like shaw is that much better at defending either, as the watford game showed
Shaw is so fucking fat, motherfucker never moves. So glad Williams played today and showed what the standard for work rate should be for a modern FullBack.
Post a pic of yourself then mate, and a video of you doing 50m sprints
I mean the yellow today was horeshit
He's had a couple needless ones in other games. I love it cause he clearly cares but long term needs to change
Agreed. The commentators said it's his 4th though so he's had 3 more in 4 games.
Can't start every game when you get a yellow in all of them.
Our academy players have been amazing this season, stepping up despite the pressure.
I still prefer Shaw. This was Williams\u2019 best game for us though.
Sadly looks like that's becoming a bit of a habit for him
He's too quick.
Dude runs so fast. Defenders don't have enough time to get out of his way
Pereira was pretty decent. Composed and transitioned the ball well for the most part.
What an assist for the first goal, great press, great composure
Hell, I thought he was great today
Created the first goal on his own
Yeah but pereira sucks. He just isn\u2019t good enough. He never looks up while the ball is at his feet, which means either he gets a lucky assist or the attack fizzles out due to a loss of possession.
Pereira has been playing well in his last few games.
He's been playing better but he makes bonehead mistakes still.
He's playing better but still not enough. Needs to keep improving. Might be another year or 2 until he has a real shout at being someone that can change the game.
Didn't he join in January?
That\u2019s why I thought you meant he had a bad half season. Jan-May.
Tbh I dont rate mctominay at all. I think hes pretty shit and I'd rather play matic over him, especially against sides who sit back. \n\nEdit:He can do a job off the ball but i still think hes one of the worst players on the ball we've ever had.
Yeah everyone to their own and I'm not having a go but I don't really trust your judgement on him as anything more than personal as I people argued with you about him over Fred. I again don't intend to be ignorant.
Particularly in the first 2 months. Rashford missed 2-3 sitters from James.
Man could you imagine if he had been servicing someone like Haaland since the beginning of this season?
That Liverpool game was when I truly appreciated that mentality I hope he inspires everyone else in the squad.
Brandon kept his cool so well too. I would have flipped shit.
Brandon literally flipped.
Seriously, consider it. Mike Dean thought Brandon Williams did a literal front flip at full speed.
He has a tendency to like attention, which is a horrible trait for an official.
Yep, just shit rather than corrupt.
Hanlon\u2019s Razor.
Ya know what I disagree. I think ability wise he is the best ref in england, the problem is he likes to put himself in the spotlight.
I blame the FA years of this they make billions in sponsors and TV deals yet refuse to invest it. Could claim corruption on their part
Williams might give him a run for his money
I don\u2019t think we can use the whole close to top 4 thing as a huge defence of Ole because Spurs, Chelsea and Arsenal are all wank. Leicester are playing at the level a top 4 team should be and we\u2019re still fairly far behind them .
Why do you people even bother watching if all you want is to be #oleout.\n\nIt's like you negative people thrive on us losing just to say 'ole is shit'
Fred and composure. Never thought id see the day
I was thinking that during the game, especially the last 20 minutes. He and matic did well at controlling the tempo when they did receive the ball. Fred in particular made some great outlet passes when he was under pressure. Last year, he would have made some costly mistakes, but today, he was nearly flawless advancing the ball from deep.
It's like when Bruce Banner and The Hulk made up and became friends.
Matic was an absolute necessity in a game like this. Sometimes you just need a giant Serb out there.
Agreed. One thing Matic excels at is using his body to protect the ball and he was excellent at doing that today. That was one of his best performances for us in a long time.
I would say it was his best performance this year
It looked like season 1 matic today.
Matic was incredible. I wrote him off, but he was terrific today and good in the last game.
It's okay, I knocked three times on wood(ward)
Either way Ed is an arse if he doesn\u2019t deliver.\n\nCan\u2019t forget that summer where he basically got Mourinho nothing
Not without signing about 3 players first. He\u2019s not great but can play about 4 different positions between attack and midfield. Imagine Rashford and Martial get injured, we\u2019ll count a on Lingard in that scenario
I wouldn\u2019t mind shipping Lingard , unsure if there are takers that he might be willing to go to. Plus being a Manchester lad he might be kept around
He\u2019s a quality rotation player w high energy and enough skill to make a difference. No reason to ship him now.
He scored and assisted in December
Not in a premier league match, no?
So many that needs to go before him. At least he is useful in some matches.
I feel like you say he is useful but then after every match he gets completely bashed
0 goals and 0 assists in the PL for over a year isn\u2019t exactly useful. His value comes from running around
Yes he had some solid passes to break Burnleys press and unlocked Fred to play with some freedom
Must have been while my pint was blocking the view because I didn't see any of that.
Yea, he did not put a foot wrong tbh. He played like an old school DM, just regulated possession and stayed back to break attacks. He left all the attacking stuuf to Fred and Pereira.
Clattenburg is the one that stands out to me.  Oliver is the only ref who is half competent anymore.
Mature from old Young
Not disagreeing but one thing I\u2019ve noticed about Fred is he always makes himself available for a pass.
Yes but this time fred could pass the ball fowards or to the overlapping williams
Thought rashford looked tired and uncharacteristically uninterested today before his goal. Should've looked to shoot way more.
Looked like they\u2019d close him off anytime he got right outside the box. Made the right choice to pass out and wait for better opportunities
Can confirm.\n\nSource: Me
Matic and Fred ice cool, Ashley Young showing some leadership
Yeah, aside from that one crazy pass to Mata a few matches ago, I think he tries too hard to make worldie passes and that screws him up.
And yes I am getting over-excited. Sue me
Trying not to run into someone at a full sprint and still getting your leg taken out? Nah not having that it was a dive.
You must've not seen the replay from  the back camera angle
In that case I don\u2019t even want to imagine how bad it could be!
WORST MANAGER IN THE LEAGUE
Lol thanks man. That'd be awesome if I could buy the whole team one or two beers lol. I may actually buy a Rashford jersey now haha
Haha yeah that was  unbelievable, lost my voice for a sec lol
I'd really love to know who this magic manager that'll please them is. I've a feeling they'll bitch regardless of who it is.
RW greenwood and James?
Greenwood is a CF for me. I want him to excel there. However, he can be a rotation on that side
Is this talking about us or arsenal?
I'd like to see that but im conflicted because I want arsenal to suffer till the end of the season.
Let's go for a draw then.
Ole has definitely reinstalled the fighting spirit that the team had lost under Mourinho but we still look lost at times. There\u2019s no doubt that the players will never stop running for Ole but what\u2019s our plan other than counter attacking?
One step at the time. It takes time. I am seeing improvments, especially individual ones. Were deadly when counter attacking which we were not before. Our defense is better too. \n\nWith a few midfielders to stabalize the squad I think we will start seeing a lot of improvement. Breaking down defensive teams is quite hard without the needed creativity. Pogba shows that quite well when playing.
That will come with key additions to the squad and also(and probably more importantly) simply through the current squad growing a little bit older and wiser and more used to each other.  \n\nBreaking up bus parking defenses is probably going to be the main focus of next summer's preseason training, or at least it should be.
Is that true? Isn\u2019t there some awful stat about how few points we have won in games where we\u2019ve lost the first goal?
Periera lacking technical quality? Mate, he is probably our second best Attacking midfielder at the moment.
Well because we have only two decent AMs
Hopefully it will remain his task, I don't see a better option, he's got a lot of things right, Ive watched so many dire performances over the last 7 years, but even when we play badly with ole it's a lack of quality.\n\nHes shown against the big boys he's got tactical guile, so I want him to figure it out and improve our squad for the future.
I have also noticed this. I don't know if it's lack of awareness or overconfidence that he can keep the ball despite being pressed. Probay the former as they usually come from behind.
Absolutely. It's very easy to forget these guys get short winded and tired legs. They really came to play today though. Very happy with today. Burnley away isn't easy.
Even argument is always welcome and I agree with what you said. But there are some folks who go into hiding when we win because they are staunchly Ole out. They tend to work OT when we lose.
There are 200 thousand members here. Most of them go into hiding at any given situation. That's not saying much.\n\nSome of us are always here. You know who they are.\n\nThose may be lurkers who interject only when things are extremely good or extremely bad you're talking about. I'd pay more attention to those consistent discussion contributors, than the reactionary ones.
I've literally seen people saying \"This win doesn't mean anything. I still would rather have Poch than Ole\" even after wins. Not every Ole out person is same.
You're saying people are different? Mind blown!\n\nOf course everyone is different, which makes the previous comment and the following comments after the one I made odd. They're each pigeonholing vast swaths of our fanbase. \n\nPoint of note: That quote you bring up makes more sense in a \"bigger picture\" way. Meaning, one win or two wins doesn't matter as much if it's just 1 or 2 wins in 15 games. Just as, if Ole has some amazing wins, especially against the top teams, but overall loses against the majority and ends up mid table or lower, then it wasn't really a good season. And I'd bet those people who said things like that are trying to hedge their bets. Those people think going with Poch will ultimately get United to where they need to go more than Ole can.\n\nI'm not agreeing with that. I personally am not #OLEOUT nor #OLEIN. I like a lot of what Ole brings, and his overall long term plan. If he can pull it off, then awesome. However, he then has to actually successfully carry out his plans. If he talks a good game, but never delivers, then he must go. Unfortunately, by then Poch will be gone.
>But there is no reason to get carried away \n\n... calling for a sacking after a short period of time
I've been very critical of United since Ferguson left, but I rarely if ever comment on sacking managers or any personal.\n\nEven if Ole was hung out to dry in summer, I don't think this is good enough. I may just have gotten cynical, but the current squad has not given me a reason to change my opinion yet.\n\nIf they keep up the results until the end of the season, then I'll happily eat my words, there are 54 points up for grasp so plenty could change, but until they do, I see no reason to have blind faith that all will change.
Go root for another team.
Absolutely. Would also like to start Pereira over Lingard any day of the week. He did quite well.
Lingard can just press.  That's all
And sucks that Brandon got carded for getting tackled.
Maybe but he wasn't giving as much effort and he looked slow. Feel like he didn't trust his legs when he bottled that chance on goal as well.
He has on multiple occasions
Potential future club captain!
Isn't that McTominay, ideally?
It's tough,to me it seems like he dives over the outstretched leg to avoid contact. He could have hit the leg and taken the hit but tried to avoid it. Either way I feel like the defender was at fault for making a dangerous situation
He got a yellow for what Dean thought was a dive.
Fuck Mike Dean
It was  a clear dive, did you see the replay?
Every time he goes down like that I fear for his career. And every time he gets back up I am left dumbfounded!
I love both Tonys all the same \ud83d\ude05
Hmmm I have never seen the two in the same room at the same time.
Without pogba and awb
Traore playing like a Valencia regen. Absolute unit.
Man United can kidnap Mikel Arteta, and give Mata to disguise as Mikel Arteta.
alright hahahah
My MeMaw can Cantona kick the dentures down your MeMaw's mouth.
My MeMaw is a Bare Breasted Marauder who two foots man city players for breakfast.
his passing surely has to be contending for the best in the PL among centerbacks
We were level on points with newcastle when we played them??
And Burnley are level with Arsenal at the moment...
Just a few days ago everyone was lamenting our inability to beat the lower teams lol. Funny how quick the narrative changes for some people.
could say that for watford,newcastle,bouremouth,southampton and etc
[deleted]
Because it's stupid and incorrect? Burnley and Newcastle have same or more points than Arsenal.
It\u2019d be great if he could chip in 5 goals a season or something. Something we are sorely missing outside of Pogba.
Yea for sure but alas every time I see his eyes light up in front of goal I think it's time to put the kettle on.
Sorry have to give it to Harry.\n\nImagine who else would play in CB now
Sorry I give that to Grealish/Haaland/Havertz/Sancho, because they\u2019re coming to us this season
We have 2 contenders for signing of the season. Is this a simulation??
Fred 2 Electric Bugaloo for me.
never thought this day would come
I'm not worried about Williams. He's like mcsauce. It's usually him that fucks other people up.
Speaks more to the nature of this sub and how they scapegoat rather than the truth of Young's strengths and abilities.
very true
He doesn't even need to play every game you wet fart
The problem isn't that he is playing every single game. The problem is we have too many players that will put in an unpredictable performance. Young, Mata, Lingard, Pereira are all easy shouts.. At their best, they can hold their own. At their worst, they're unbelievably poor.
I\u2019d rather give Ethan Laird a shot at right back. One decent performance and it\u2019s lets keep Young, if he got an extension this sub would go into meltdown. \n\nHe\u2019s part of the deadwood, thanks for the memories but goodbye.
while he slipped on the ground.
Goal of the season contender that.
Can Arsenal please turn up tomorrow?
Slide \u00a320m to Everton to 2-foot Liverpool's entire XI with their rotation players, then an extra \u00a310m to 20 foot Van Dijk for good measure
Greenwood almost guarantees a goal a game. I'd start him on the right
I think it\u2019s the other way around, let Greenwood start, bag a banger and then unleash a fully rested James on a tired Mustafi
That almost makes them a top 6 team
He had a good game but the dive was disappointing.
You see a dive i see a player get kicked and trying to have his legs not broke
Poor reffing. He's plainly kicked in the thigh, but Dean doesn't want to send off Bardsley.
Just goes to show majority of us (including me) knows fuck all about football
We've had no problem beating world class teams, have we?
Same, wouldn\u2019t count on Arsenal beating Chelsea tbh, but hey they\u2019re both shit so who knows.
Y
should have 1-2 reds atleast tbf fuck mike dean stupid ugly bald cunt
What? Matic is the slowest one on the ball in that midfield. Always takes 2 3 more touches than he should
I thought he moved the ball pretty well today. mctominay passes the ball to the opponents under no pressure about 5 times a game .
If you had set Matic is better than McTominay in games like this against the low block, I would agree.
That's exactly what I'm proposing. Against the bus parkers play matic and against the sides that will dominate us play mctominay.
Don't know why you are being down voted. Against low block, he is decent.
Mctominay is the most protected player on this sub lmao
A destroyer in every sense of the word, lmao
r/angryupvote
Bahahaha. Brutal. Accurate...but brutal.
\ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02
One bad game and everybody will have his head. I think he should go if we get a replacement because he's already declining and isn't fit for a fast paced league anymore
If he's fine playing a bit part role, I'd have him tollthe end of the season. It's going to be hard getting anyone of real quality to join our midfield in January, so with what we have, matic will provide an extra bit of experience. I hope
Crumpsall \ud83d\ude4c
True. Forgot about that.
And none of them worked! I was waiting for one of them to leak out but we were a wall today.
Draw is the best result and 7 red cards
They NEVER miss an opportunity to bring it up. Lmaoo
I know I know. It\u2019s so good seeing us play with some identity though, only a few players letting us down now instead of the whole team
Yeah earned win today
Saved
That one burns and I'm a United fan
It\u2019s happ-y en-d-ing!
I think he\u2019s scored enough with the left foot. His right deserves a chance now
Or maybe he'll score a RVP-esque flying Dutchman world cup goal with a cross coming in from AWB
Shaw is just as vulnerable as hes is slow getting back,  with Brandon he adjusts where as Shaw is always jogging back slowly
100% agere. Williams will be a starting player in the future, but he does like safe passing a lot.
Fred and mctominay are box to box players, they have done well there but imo a defensive mid alongside Fred will make him much better
I know that, but Fred\u2019s filled in excellently. Matic will get caught out more against more technical and pacy teams.\n\nBurnley played long ball, physical football. Played right into Matic\u2019s hands.
If you don\u2019t foul him, what can you do? If he gets a yard on you, you\u2019re not getting it back.
Granted, but the amount of spikes and hip checks he\u2019s taking are ridiculous.
It was ridiculous the amount of fouls on the poor kid the dreadful ref just let go. Stupid horrible ref.
agreed, could've been multiple called
Thanks tor speaking up and knowing what this club is!
Thanks and same to you, too many fans seem to miss the point glad there are enough fans who see the big picture too.
Lol!!!! Sad
Beating the poor teams is what we struggle at though ...
Are you ever happy
Gtfo plastic boy
Beat the top teams and its it doesn't matter unless we beat the lower teams, beat the lower teams and it's yeah but theyre shit lol...
> James is the better option against a Top 6 club\n\nHe was talking about Arsenal
crazy how we were 14th at one point and now were 7 points clear of them lol
Loved it. Pace of pass was good
Totally understand. Are the ones with players on them match day specific though? I legitimately don\u2019t know. I think they\u2019re awesome though. I\u2019m calling those  match-day scarves because I don\u2019t see them available on the United store ever. I\u2019d love to have one with Rashford, Martial, or De Gea on it.
They aren\u2019t match day specific. There is match day specific ones but the ones you\u2019re mentioning aren\u2019t.
They\u2019re not going to be on the store because they\u2019re sold by locals. No idea why I\u2019m getting downvoted and couldn\u2019t give a fuck but I\u2019m not wrong.\n\nI think it\u2019s odd that you\u2019d want a memento of a game you didn\u2019t go to, but hey, you do you.
I live in Singapore, trust me if I could attend every single MUFC game, I would. That makes me less of a fan? Would you stay up till 4 in the morning JUST to watch United? Even now?
Real class, so because you get to live near OUR team and attend the games frequently, you're better than a fellow dedicated fan from the other side of the world. Fuck you 3000!\nI live in the states and would give my left ball to be at Old Trafford for one game. ANY GAME.
[removed]
[removed]
It's about damn time.
cheers
nice to see someone answer honestly lol.
Lol
It\u2019s a meme from a few seasons ago
it was tight because of his first touch
Yeah he should have whacked it with his left.
He\u2019s still not close to good enough in pretty much any game.
Just lol at the excuses you guys keep making for him.
No, it has to be from my own pocket. Sacrifices must be made.
Agreed! Rashford been our best player this season
Thanks, could never understand it
He is not.
Not against Shaw completely but he\u2019s only gotten worse when it comes to his attacking contribution. Him against Newcastle on Boxing Day vs Williams today were night and day
Arsenal win would be good too, I just don\u2019t have faith of them being able to do anything, they\u2019re awful. Meh no one is going to catch Liverpool, Leicester choked when they needed to show something.
I\u2019ve accepted Pool winning the league, still don\u2019t want them to end undefeated or with a record tally or anything.
Look we all hate Pool, but we need to be realistic, better to have the teams around us dropping points to solidify at least a 5th place showing for the time being. Don\u2019t let your hate blind you, United first.
GGMU
Oops Sean gets it from the worms that he eats daily.
Isn\u2019t that how CR7 got his crazy goal record?
Just twerking for Jose for when transfer window opens
Cheeky swap for Son, worth it worth it.
He was still replaced by someone
Ole out group are on sucide watch
well ackshually I don't get invited to parties. so there. Also, it was a joke playing on our record of winning vs top 6, not picking up as many points against teams below us... Maybe you didn't hear me properly?
> *ackshually*
Literally shaking rn
You\u2019re ignoring his contributions out of possession and his dead ball ability.
I've been one of his biggest critics but there has been a serious up turn in his displays recently. Not saying he is starting or even squad quality for the long run but he has certainly upped his game.
I think my criticism of mctominay is pretty fair. I've always said that he has a good defensive workrate which is useful against teams who dominate us but when it's time to play against teams who hand us possession hes one of the reasons we struggle to break down teams. His passing is genuinely shocking and I'm not sure I've seen a United midfielder as bad as him with the ball at his feet. I always compare mctominay to fred because I want people to realise what proper united quality midfielder looks like.
Nah, like your comments on him purely reek of personal vendetta due to internet arguments
I want what is best for the club and Ole leaving is what is best for the club. I'd rather we win and Ole be successful but we will never win a league title with him in charge.
> I want what is best for the club and Ole leaving is what is best for the  club. I'd rather we win and Ole be successful but we will never win a  league title with him in charge. \n\nu/mrpiggywinkles52, So you are admitting you want us to lose just so Ole gets the sacked?\n\nPlastic.
What\u2019s the benchmark for \u201cquality rotation player\u201d?  No goals or assists in a year is abysmal
Quality rotation player is an energetic veteran with skill like Lingard.
No, but you didn't make that distinction when you generally said 'A year with no no assists, goals...'
His pressing and false runs create trouble for opponents who plays with a high defensive line, making it more likely that we can hit them on the break. How is that not useful?
> His pressing and false runs\n\nThus just a more subtle way of saying work rate. It\u2019s literally the bare minimum for this system. This is what we expect from any player. In things that matter such as passing and finishing, he falls woefully short. He has good energy but his true place in the squad at a top team is 3rd or 4th choice. I doubt any club above 15th place would even take him as a starter
You're the only one mate
No one else in the supporters pub felt he did anything either. Love being down voted as if I talked shit about him.
Fair enough
What was he supposed to do? Run into his leg and get injured. As long as he wasn't rolling around like Neymar or shouting at the ref, he didn't deserve the yellow.
Yeah no doubt there are users who are really well reasoned and I love to read their opinions, one way or the other. But there are other regulars as well who are unreasonable to a point that no rebuttal can change their minds.
>I see no reason to have blind faith\n\nDid you miss the three summer transfers? \n\nI think the issue is with your outlook and the weird selective view that has given you.\n\n>blind faith\n\nwell you are half way with those blinkers on
No I didn't miss it, since I noticed that they got rid of two high profile players without trying to either upgrade or replace them.\n\nIt's great that United finally bought a first choice right back, and Maguire was a good buy. But it has not translated in to points yet, and apparently pointing that out makes me a shit fan.\n\nBut having followed United for 20 years, I should suddenly start being happy with anything.\n\nIf the consensus is that the eternal process that keeps United consistently at sub 70 points is fine, then I guess my standards are too high.
The future is now
\ud83e\udd2b
Sounds tough, she played centre half for Burnley?
#CSKA MOSKVA\n\nFite me.
Ha ha. Yeah. I think shooting practice needs to be next on the agenda.... amazing he is allowed to take some direct freekicks too!
Not Haaland anymore hahaha
Did he actually sign with Juventus then or is he staying?
He will get his chance I'm sure, young won't be in the way of that.\n\nYoung has proved time and time again that there is a space for him in this club.
I\u2019m not saying for a minute I\u2019m not grateful for everything he\u2019s done for United but in my opinion it\u2019s best to just let him go. \n\nWe\u2019ve been too sentimental to certain players and we need to be more ruthless to let Wan Bissaka, Laird, Dalot, Shaw and Williams take over.
I guess you haven't watched this team enough this season. McT is much better at both breaking attacks on the halfway line and keeping the ball. It's Fred's job to play the through balls.\nMatic will get the ball and take too long before passing so he doesn't give the ball away but slows down the attacks.
I've watched 90% of our games this season.\n\n>McT is much better at both breaking attacks on the halfway line and keeping the ball. I\n\nMctominay is probably better at breaking up attacks but he definitely isnt better at keeping the ball. Just look at their overall pass accuracy this season. Matic's passing accuracy is higher.\n\n\n>Matic will get the ball and take too long before passing so he doesn't give the ball away but slows down the attacks.\n\n Idk man matic moved the ball pretty well today and has been moving it well ever since he came back from injury.
This is the time of year which separates the men from the boys.\n\nIf we can keep getting points now we'll be in the race for top 4. That's good enough for me for now.
Arsenal always start well and tail off by the end. Remember they were top of the league at Christmas a few seasons and finished 4th eventually.
Don\u2019t the match-day ones have both teams/date on it?
Yep
Me either, I appreciate the feedback! But like I said, I want one with one of the players on it, which sounds like they aren\u2019t match-day specific. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d want one with both teams on it. \n\nI was calling them match-day scarves because I figured the ones with the players were only sold on match day if I am understanding correctly.\n\nEdit: in other words, I should say scarves that are sold on match-day.  My bad
Nah that\u2019s cool man I totally get it. Like I said originally I\u2019m not trying to be a dick at all.\n\nDm me I\u2019ll try to sort something out for you
Of course, but we play them once more still and nothing would be sweeter than to beat them and end any talk of an invincibles season.
In about 2 years mctominay he will struggle to make our bench and i want you to remember what u/cmonunited said about him \"hes bang average \". He would struggle to get a game for Brighton ffs.
As I said you clearly have an agenda against him, I will take my judgements from those who aren't invested.
I literally said I'd rather we win and I'd rather Ole be successful but that simply isn't going to happen and I'd rather we didn't all bury our heads in the sand and pretend everything is fine. Doing that is exactly how we got here. \n\nOle should've been sacked at the end of last season. He wasn't. As a result this season is virtually wasted. By burying our heads in the sand and pretending what we've seen this season is acceptable when Jose was sacked with LESS points is just ridiculous. We're only close to top 4 because Arsenal shit the bed, Lampard is inexperienced and Mourinho was taking over a shitshow of a spurs side and is a shell of his former self. You really think Ole would be competing with actual elite managers if those clubs had them in charge? We cannot and should not accept what we've gotten this season, if we do then we become more and more like the early 2010s Liverpool. Solskjaer is clearly not good enough and if we pretend like everything is OK and accept anything less than a top 4 finish without sacking him we'll waste next season too.\n\nI'd love him to be a success but he hasn't shown me anything to make me think he will be, Tactically he isn't on the level of even someone like Rodgers. His subs are often poor albeit he has limited materials to work with, he has no idea how to break down a bus, he relies far too much on counter attacking, our defence is bang average despite being a lot better on paper and there is no coherent structure, no plan to break down a defence and no patterns of play worth shit. I can't tell you what our style of  play even is beyond counters?\n\nHe's done some great things. Clearing out the deadwood, 3 good signings, improving Rashford, Scott, Martial, Fred etc. But he will not take us forwards. I hope he is successful but I know he won't be and him leaving is best for everyone. I go into every game wanting us to win but I accept that the manager isn't good enough and should've been sacked by now. The problem with people that are ardent Solskjaer defenders seems to be that many of them assume that wanting a new manager means wanting the club to fail and that you are a plastic, which is a bullshit elitist mentality when I literally said the opposite.
We won against Pep and Mourinho. We started figuring out low block teams, but yet Ole is still not enough for you mouth watering ole out plastics.\n\nAlso, I notice all the Ole out people constantly saying they can't see the tactics we are doing. maybe cause you are just a football fan with FM2019/Fifa 2019 knowledge? This people earned their coaching badges, I am sure they know more tactics then the armchair experts
Shouldn\u2019t be a starter for us neither, I don\u2019t think anyone is claiming that.
I agree. But for the level we aspire to be at, he shouldn\u2019t even be on the bench. Look at the squads of City, Liverpool, Leicester and Chelsea and see if he would even make the bench at those clubs. It\u2019s only because he\u2019s a local lad that he\u2019s survived so long. I don\u2019t hate the guy. I know he cares about the club and tries hard, but when an 18 year old with zero top flight experience before this season has scored more winners than he has, then it definitely is a sign that he needs to leave. Next summer, we should be looking to move on Jones, Rojo, Lingard, and Matic in that order
> are we sure he actually played? Near invisible.
Yes, that's exactly the same as complaining about a poor performance. Cheers for pointing that out. Expert analysis there.
>No I didn't miss it, since I noticed that they got rid of two high profile players without trying to either upgrade or replace them.\n\nlol like replacing Sanchez.  There is a process to go through and some crap to clean up.  3 starting signings is great.  Really absurd that you want Ole out and part of your justification is the summer signings.\n\n>apparently pointing that out makes me a shit fan\n\n>I noticed that they got rid of two high profile players without trying to either upgrade or replace them.\n\nNa it is your your logic and entitlement that is being questioned.  Your blind faith statement is absurdly irrational.\n\n>But having followed United for 20 years, I should suddenly start being happy with anything\n\nAbout 45 years here.  You seem to have an entitlement from watching us from and through the glory years.  I wasn't even part of the SAF (no S then) out brigade.\n\n>If the consensus is that the eternal process that keeps United consistently at sub 70 points is fine, then I guess my standards are too high.\n\nThere is hope that something new can be built now.  Weird you want to cut it off early.\n\nI totally get that how this should have played out is Ole not getting the early contract and then we would have Poch as manager now.  But that isn't what happened and Ole has shown he can sign starting players and deal with the predecessors issues (like loaning out the worst signing in EPL history).
If you said Zenit St. Petersburg my doubts of your MeMaw being Andrey Arshavin would have vanished.
Dortmund
DMed
So? Anyone can beat anyone, its the premier league. I don't see how we've started figuring out low block teams when we just lost to Watford, Burnley and Newcastle also absolutely gifted goals to us and we didn't create hardly any chances against Burnley really.\n\nI'm not a fortune teller, but the guy isn't a miracle worker, the signs aren't there. Call me a plastic all you want but sadly I'll be proven write.
Ole lose: ALL HIS FAULT\n\nOle wins: OPPONENT GAVE US THE WIN\n\nsums up you lot. Gtfo troll
The fact it\u2019s \u201cyou lot\u201d shows the Glazers are winning. We\u2019re all fans, we all want what\u2019s best for the club. We just differ on how to do it.  \n\nIt\u2019s not only oles fault. It\u2019s the boards and players too but only one of those things can be changed immediately
Nah, don't try and do that \"if you support Ole means you support  the glazers\" shit on me.\n\nWe are winning and you still only focus on the negative. Just gtfo. blocked.
I\u2019m not saying you support the Glazers. But they\u2019re trying To lower expectations and they are succeeding. \n\nI\u2019m not focusing on the negative. I\u2019m staying realistic and grounded. There is no point in burying our head in the sand.
Fuck Burnley \u2705
Here we go! \u2705
Haaland \u2705
Fuck
Trinidad \u2705 Tobago \u2705
Don't say that name in front of the Americans mate. They're gonna get triggered.
Dwight \u2705 \n\nYorke \u2705
Dirty players, thank god Mike Dean wasn't having none of it.
Fuck Biggie
Add Jon moss, the fat cunt to the list as well.
Where is jon moss?
Getting fucked.
TBF I thought Mike Dean was poor for both sides today. As always.
Probably won't sadly
Couldn't agree more. It's turning into a Hazard situation.
Has to
Yeah, it\u2019s getting absurd. At some point the whole \u201cthey didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d get to the ball!\u201d excise doesn\u2019t cut it.
When you say refs aren\u2019t protecting him do you mean as in they aren\u2019t giving yellows out quick enough for fouls on him? Cheers
Yes. If fouls go unpunished, the ref\u2019s simply enabling another free tactical foul later on that will then take a (later than deserved) yellow, which really isn\u2019t a significant punishment to a defensive team like Burnley that want to break up play and make it a fight.
Yeah at some point you have to put it out there
Lmao
Yeah really not sure why Williams didn't go LM and Shaw LB at the end there
its not like shaw is that much better at defending either, as the watford game showed
Shaw is so fucking fat, motherfucker never moves. So glad Williams played today and showed what the standard for work rate should be for a modern FullBack.
Post a pic of yourself then mate, and a video of you doing 50m sprints
I mean the yellow today was horeshit
He's had a couple needless ones in other games. I love it cause he clearly cares but long term needs to change
Agreed. The commentators said it's his 4th though so he's had 3 more in 4 games.
Can't start every game when you get a yellow in all of them.
Our academy players have been amazing this season, stepping up despite the pressure.
I still prefer Shaw. This was Williams\u2019 best game for us though.
Sadly looks like that's becoming a bit of a habit for him
He's too quick.
Dude runs so fast. Defenders don't have enough time to get out of his way
Pereira was pretty decent. Composed and transitioned the ball well for the most part.
What an assist for the first goal, great press, great composure
Hell, I thought he was great today
Created the first goal on his own
Yeah but pereira sucks. He just isn\u2019t good enough. He never looks up while the ball is at his feet, which means either he gets a lucky assist or the attack fizzles out due to a loss of possession.
Pereira has been playing well in his last few games.
He's been playing better but he makes bonehead mistakes still.
He's playing better but still not enough. Needs to keep improving. Might be another year or 2 until he has a real shout at being someone that can change the game.
Didn't he join in January?
That\u2019s why I thought you meant he had a bad half season. Jan-May.
Tbh I dont rate mctominay at all. I think hes pretty shit and I'd rather play matic over him, especially against sides who sit back. \n\nEdit:He can do a job off the ball but i still think hes one of the worst players on the ball we've ever had.
Yeah everyone to their own and I'm not having a go but I don't really trust your judgement on him as anything more than personal as I people argued with you about him over Fred. I again don't intend to be ignorant.
Particularly in the first 2 months. Rashford missed 2-3 sitters from James.
Man could you imagine if he had been servicing someone like Haaland since the beginning of this season?
That Liverpool game was when I truly appreciated that mentality I hope he inspires everyone else in the squad.
Brandon kept his cool so well too. I would have flipped shit.
Brandon literally flipped.
Seriously, consider it. Mike Dean thought Brandon Williams did a literal front flip at full speed.
He has a tendency to like attention, which is a horrible trait for an official.
Yep, just shit rather than corrupt.
Hanlon\u2019s Razor.
Ya know what I disagree. I think ability wise he is the best ref in england, the problem is he likes to put himself in the spotlight.
I blame the FA years of this they make billions in sponsors and TV deals yet refuse to invest it. Could claim corruption on their part
Williams might give him a run for his money
I don\u2019t think we can use the whole close to top 4 thing as a huge defence of Ole because Spurs, Chelsea and Arsenal are all wank. Leicester are playing at the level a top 4 team should be and we\u2019re still fairly far behind them .
Why do you people even bother watching if all you want is to be #oleout.\n\nIt's like you negative people thrive on us losing just to say 'ole is shit'
Fred and composure. Never thought id see the day
I was thinking that during the game, especially the last 20 minutes. He and matic did well at controlling the tempo when they did receive the ball. Fred in particular made some great outlet passes when he was under pressure. Last year, he would have made some costly mistakes, but today, he was nearly flawless advancing the ball from deep.
It's like when Bruce Banner and The Hulk made up and became friends.
Matic was an absolute necessity in a game like this. Sometimes you just need a giant Serb out there.
Agreed. One thing Matic excels at is using his body to protect the ball and he was excellent at doing that today. That was one of his best performances for us in a long time.
I would say it was his best performance this year
It looked like season 1 matic today.
Matic was incredible. I wrote him off, but he was terrific today and good in the last game.
It's okay, I knocked three times on wood(ward)
Either way Ed is an arse if he doesn\u2019t deliver.\n\nCan\u2019t forget that summer where he basically got Mourinho nothing
Not without signing about 3 players first. He\u2019s not great but can play about 4 different positions between attack and midfield. Imagine Rashford and Martial get injured, we\u2019ll count a on Lingard in that scenario
I wouldn\u2019t mind shipping Lingard , unsure if there are takers that he might be willing to go to. Plus being a Manchester lad he might be kept around
He\u2019s a quality rotation player w high energy and enough skill to make a difference. No reason to ship him now.
He scored and assisted in December
Not in a premier league match, no?
So many that needs to go before him. At least he is useful in some matches.
I feel like you say he is useful but then after every match he gets completely bashed
0 goals and 0 assists in the PL for over a year isn\u2019t exactly useful. His value comes from running around
Yes he had some solid passes to break Burnleys press and unlocked Fred to play with some freedom
Must have been while my pint was blocking the view because I didn't see any of that.
Yea, he did not put a foot wrong tbh. He played like an old school DM, just regulated possession and stayed back to break attacks. He left all the attacking stuuf to Fred and Pereira.
Clattenburg is the one that stands out to me.  Oliver is the only ref who is half competent anymore.
Mature from old Young
Not disagreeing but one thing I\u2019ve noticed about Fred is he always makes himself available for a pass.
Yes but this time fred could pass the ball fowards or to the overlapping williams
Thought rashford looked tired and uncharacteristically uninterested today before his goal. Should've looked to shoot way more.
Looked like they\u2019d close him off anytime he got right outside the box. Made the right choice to pass out and wait for better opportunities
Can confirm.\n\nSource: Me
Matic and Fred ice cool, Ashley Young showing some leadership
Yeah, aside from that one crazy pass to Mata a few matches ago, I think he tries too hard to make worldie passes and that screws him up.
And yes I am getting over-excited. Sue me
Trying not to run into someone at a full sprint and still getting your leg taken out? Nah not having that it was a dive.
You must've not seen the replay from  the back camera angle
In that case I don\u2019t even want to imagine how bad it could be!
WORST MANAGER IN THE LEAGUE
Lol thanks man. That'd be awesome if I could buy the whole team one or two beers lol. I may actually buy a Rashford jersey now haha
Haha yeah that was  unbelievable, lost my voice for a sec lol
I'd really love to know who this magic manager that'll please them is. I've a feeling they'll bitch regardless of who it is.
RW greenwood and James?
Greenwood is a CF for me. I want him to excel there. However, he can be a rotation on that side
Is this talking about us or arsenal?
I'd like to see that but im conflicted because I want arsenal to suffer till the end of the season.
Let's go for a draw then.
Ole has definitely reinstalled the fighting spirit that the team had lost under Mourinho but we still look lost at times. There\u2019s no doubt that the players will never stop running for Ole but what\u2019s our plan other than counter attacking?
One step at the time. It takes time. I am seeing improvments, especially individual ones. Were deadly when counter attacking which we were not before. Our defense is better too. \n\nWith a few midfielders to stabalize the squad I think we will start seeing a lot of improvement. Breaking down defensive teams is quite hard without the needed creativity. Pogba shows that quite well when playing.
That will come with key additions to the squad and also(and probably more importantly) simply through the current squad growing a little bit older and wiser and more used to each other.  \n\nBreaking up bus parking defenses is probably going to be the main focus of next summer's preseason training, or at least it should be.
Is that true? Isn\u2019t there some awful stat about how few points we have won in games where we\u2019ve lost the first goal?
Periera lacking technical quality? Mate, he is probably our second best Attacking midfielder at the moment.
Well because we have only two decent AMs
Hopefully it will remain his task, I don't see a better option, he's got a lot of things right, Ive watched so many dire performances over the last 7 years, but even when we play badly with ole it's a lack of quality.\n\nHes shown against the big boys he's got tactical guile, so I want him to figure it out and improve our squad for the future.
I have also noticed this. I don't know if it's lack of awareness or overconfidence that he can keep the ball despite being pressed. Probay the former as they usually come from behind.
Absolutely. It's very easy to forget these guys get short winded and tired legs. They really came to play today though. Very happy with today. Burnley away isn't easy.
Even argument is always welcome and I agree with what you said. But there are some folks who go into hiding when we win because they are staunchly Ole out. They tend to work OT when we lose.
There are 200 thousand members here. Most of them go into hiding at any given situation. That's not saying much.\n\nSome of us are always here. You know who they are.\n\nThose may be lurkers who interject only when things are extremely good or extremely bad you're talking about. I'd pay more attention to those consistent discussion contributors, than the reactionary ones.
I've literally seen people saying \"This win doesn't mean anything. I still would rather have Poch than Ole\" even after wins. Not every Ole out person is same.
You're saying people are different? Mind blown!\n\nOf course everyone is different, which makes the previous comment and the following comments after the one I made odd. They're each pigeonholing vast swaths of our fanbase. \n\nPoint of note: That quote you bring up makes more sense in a \"bigger picture\" way. Meaning, one win or two wins doesn't matter as much if it's just 1 or 2 wins in 15 games. Just as, if Ole has some amazing wins, especially against the top teams, but overall loses against the majority and ends up mid table or lower, then it wasn't really a good season. And I'd bet those people who said things like that are trying to hedge their bets. Those people think going with Poch will ultimately get United to where they need to go more than Ole can.\n\nI'm not agreeing with that. I personally am not #OLEOUT nor #OLEIN. I like a lot of what Ole brings, and his overall long term plan. If he can pull it off, then awesome. However, he then has to actually successfully carry out his plans. If he talks a good game, but never delivers, then he must go. Unfortunately, by then Poch will be gone.
>But there is no reason to get carried away \n\n... calling for a sacking after a short period of time
I've been very critical of United since Ferguson left, but I rarely if ever comment on sacking managers or any personal.\n\nEven if Ole was hung out to dry in summer, I don't think this is good enough. I may just have gotten cynical, but the current squad has not given me a reason to change my opinion yet.\n\nIf they keep up the results until the end of the season, then I'll happily eat my words, there are 54 points up for grasp so plenty could change, but until they do, I see no reason to have blind faith that all will change.
Go root for another team.
Absolutely. Would also like to start Pereira over Lingard any day of the week. He did quite well.
Lingard can just press.  That's all
And sucks that Brandon got carded for getting tackled.
Maybe but he wasn't giving as much effort and he looked slow. Feel like he didn't trust his legs when he bottled that chance on goal as well.
He has on multiple occasions
Potential future club captain!
Isn't that McTominay, ideally?
It's tough,to me it seems like he dives over the outstretched leg to avoid contact. He could have hit the leg and taken the hit but tried to avoid it. Either way I feel like the defender was at fault for making a dangerous situation
He got a yellow for what Dean thought was a dive.
Fuck Mike Dean
It was  a clear dive, did you see the replay?
Every time he goes down like that I fear for his career. And every time he gets back up I am left dumbfounded!
I love both Tonys all the same \ud83d\ude05
Hmmm I have never seen the two in the same room at the same time.
Without pogba and awb
Traore playing like a Valencia regen. Absolute unit.
Man United can kidnap Mikel Arteta, and give Mata to disguise as Mikel Arteta.
alright hahahah
My MeMaw can Cantona kick the dentures down your MeMaw's mouth.
My MeMaw is a Bare Breasted Marauder who two foots man city players for breakfast.
his passing surely has to be contending for the best in the PL among centerbacks
We were level on points with newcastle when we played them??
And Burnley are level with Arsenal at the moment...
Just a few days ago everyone was lamenting our inability to beat the lower teams lol. Funny how quick the narrative changes for some people.
could say that for watford,newcastle,bouremouth,southampton and etc
[deleted]
Because it's stupid and incorrect? Burnley and Newcastle have same or more points than Arsenal.
It\u2019d be great if he could chip in 5 goals a season or something. Something we are sorely missing outside of Pogba.
Yea for sure but alas every time I see his eyes light up in front of goal I think it's time to put the kettle on.
Sorry have to give it to Harry.\n\nImagine who else would play in CB now
Sorry I give that to Grealish/Haaland/Havertz/Sancho, because they\u2019re coming to us this season
We have 2 contenders for signing of the season. Is this a simulation??
Fred 2 Electric Bugaloo for me.
never thought this day would come
I'm not worried about Williams. He's like mcsauce. It's usually him that fucks other people up.
Speaks more to the nature of this sub and how they scapegoat rather than the truth of Young's strengths and abilities.
very true
He doesn't even need to play every game you wet fart
The problem isn't that he is playing every single game. The problem is we have too many players that will put in an unpredictable performance. Young, Mata, Lingard, Pereira are all easy shouts.. At their best, they can hold their own. At their worst, they're unbelievably poor.
I\u2019d rather give Ethan Laird a shot at right back. One decent performance and it\u2019s lets keep Young, if he got an extension this sub would go into meltdown. \n\nHe\u2019s part of the deadwood, thanks for the memories but goodbye.
while he slipped on the ground.
Goal of the season contender that.
Can Arsenal please turn up tomorrow?
Slide \u00a320m to Everton to 2-foot Liverpool's entire XI with their rotation players, then an extra \u00a310m to 20 foot Van Dijk for good measure
Greenwood almost guarantees a goal a game. I'd start him on the right
I think it\u2019s the other way around, let Greenwood start, bag a banger and then unleash a fully rested James on a tired Mustafi
That almost makes them a top 6 team
He had a good game but the dive was disappointing.
You see a dive i see a player get kicked and trying to have his legs not broke
Poor reffing. He's plainly kicked in the thigh, but Dean doesn't want to send off Bardsley.
Just goes to show majority of us (including me) knows fuck all about football
We've had no problem beating world class teams, have we?
Same, wouldn\u2019t count on Arsenal beating Chelsea tbh, but hey they\u2019re both shit so who knows.
Y
should have 1-2 reds atleast tbf fuck mike dean stupid ugly bald cunt
What? Matic is the slowest one on the ball in that midfield. Always takes 2 3 more touches than he should
I thought he moved the ball pretty well today. mctominay passes the ball to the opponents under no pressure about 5 times a game .
If you had set Matic is better than McTominay in games like this against the low block, I would agree.
That's exactly what I'm proposing. Against the bus parkers play matic and against the sides that will dominate us play mctominay.
Don't know why you are being down voted. Against low block, he is decent.
Mctominay is the most protected player on this sub lmao
A destroyer in every sense of the word, lmao
r/angryupvote
Bahahaha. Brutal. Accurate...but brutal.
\ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02
One bad game and everybody will have his head. I think he should go if we get a replacement because he's already declining and isn't fit for a fast paced league anymore
If he's fine playing a bit part role, I'd have him tollthe end of the season. It's going to be hard getting anyone of real quality to join our midfield in January, so with what we have, matic will provide an extra bit of experience. I hope
Crumpsall \ud83d\ude4c
True. Forgot about that.
And none of them worked! I was waiting for one of them to leak out but we were a wall today.
Draw is the best result and 7 red cards
They NEVER miss an opportunity to bring it up. Lmaoo
I know I know. It\u2019s so good seeing us play with some identity though, only a few players letting us down now instead of the whole team
Yeah earned win today
Saved
That one burns and I'm a United fan
It\u2019s happ-y en-d-ing!
I think he\u2019s scored enough with the left foot. His right deserves a chance now
Or maybe he'll score a RVP-esque flying Dutchman world cup goal with a cross coming in from AWB
Shaw is just as vulnerable as hes is slow getting back,  with Brandon he adjusts where as Shaw is always jogging back slowly
100% agere. Williams will be a starting player in the future, but he does like safe passing a lot.
Fred and mctominay are box to box players, they have done well there but imo a defensive mid alongside Fred will make him much better
I know that, but Fred\u2019s filled in excellently. Matic will get caught out more against more technical and pacy teams.\n\nBurnley played long ball, physical football. Played right into Matic\u2019s hands.
If you don\u2019t foul him, what can you do? If he gets a yard on you, you\u2019re not getting it back.
Granted, but the amount of spikes and hip checks he\u2019s taking are ridiculous.
It was ridiculous the amount of fouls on the poor kid the dreadful ref just let go. Stupid horrible ref.
agreed, could've been multiple called
Thanks tor speaking up and knowing what this club is!
Thanks and same to you, too many fans seem to miss the point glad there are enough fans who see the big picture too.
Lol!!!! Sad
Beating the poor teams is what we struggle at though ...
Are you ever happy
Gtfo plastic boy
Beat the top teams and its it doesn't matter unless we beat the lower teams, beat the lower teams and it's yeah but theyre shit lol...
> James is the better option against a Top 6 club\n\nHe was talking about Arsenal
crazy how we were 14th at one point and now were 7 points clear of them lol
Loved it. Pace of pass was good
Totally understand. Are the ones with players on them match day specific though? I legitimately don\u2019t know. I think they\u2019re awesome though. I\u2019m calling those  match-day scarves because I don\u2019t see them available on the United store ever. I\u2019d love to have one with Rashford, Martial, or De Gea on it.
They aren\u2019t match day specific. There is match day specific ones but the ones you\u2019re mentioning aren\u2019t.
They\u2019re not going to be on the store because they\u2019re sold by locals. No idea why I\u2019m getting downvoted and couldn\u2019t give a fuck but I\u2019m not wrong.\n\nI think it\u2019s odd that you\u2019d want a memento of a game you didn\u2019t go to, but hey, you do you.
I live in Singapore, trust me if I could attend every single MUFC game, I would. That makes me less of a fan? Would you stay up till 4 in the morning JUST to watch United? Even now?
Real class, so because you get to live near OUR team and attend the games frequently, you're better than a fellow dedicated fan from the other side of the world. Fuck you 3000!\nI live in the states and would give my left ball to be at Old Trafford for one game. ANY GAME.
[removed]
[removed]
It's about damn time.
cheers
nice to see someone answer honestly lol.
Lol
It\u2019s a meme from a few seasons ago
it was tight because of his first touch
Yeah he should have whacked it with his left.
He\u2019s still not close to good enough in pretty much any game.
Just lol at the excuses you guys keep making for him.
No, it has to be from my own pocket. Sacrifices must be made.
Agreed! Rashford been our best player this season
Thanks, could never understand it
He is not.
Not against Shaw completely but he\u2019s only gotten worse when it comes to his attacking contribution. Him against Newcastle on Boxing Day vs Williams today were night and day
Arsenal win would be good too, I just don\u2019t have faith of them being able to do anything, they\u2019re awful. Meh no one is going to catch Liverpool, Leicester choked when they needed to show something.
I\u2019ve accepted Pool winning the league, still don\u2019t want them to end undefeated or with a record tally or anything.
Look we all hate Pool, but we need to be realistic, better to have the teams around us dropping points to solidify at least a 5th place showing for the time being. Don\u2019t let your hate blind you, United first.
GGMU
Oops Sean gets it from the worms that he eats daily.
Isn\u2019t that how CR7 got his crazy goal record?
Just twerking for Jose for when transfer window opens
Cheeky swap for Son, worth it worth it.
He was still replaced by someone
Ole out group are on sucide watch
well ackshually I don't get invited to parties. so there. Also, it was a joke playing on our record of winning vs top 6, not picking up as many points against teams below us... Maybe you didn't hear me properly?
> *ackshually*
Literally shaking rn
You\u2019re ignoring his contributions out of possession and his dead ball ability.
I've been one of his biggest critics but there has been a serious up turn in his displays recently. Not saying he is starting or even squad quality for the long run but he has certainly upped his game.
I think my criticism of mctominay is pretty fair. I've always said that he has a good defensive workrate which is useful against teams who dominate us but when it's time to play against teams who hand us possession hes one of the reasons we struggle to break down teams. His passing is genuinely shocking and I'm not sure I've seen a United midfielder as bad as him with the ball at his feet. I always compare mctominay to fred because I want people to realise what proper united quality midfielder looks like.
Nah, like your comments on him purely reek of personal vendetta due to internet arguments
I want what is best for the club and Ole leaving is what is best for the club. I'd rather we win and Ole be successful but we will never win a league title with him in charge.
> I want what is best for the club and Ole leaving is what is best for the  club. I'd rather we win and Ole be successful but we will never win a  league title with him in charge. \n\nu/mrpiggywinkles52, So you are admitting you want us to lose just so Ole gets the sacked?\n\nPlastic.
What\u2019s the benchmark for \u201cquality rotation player\u201d?  No goals or assists in a year is abysmal
Quality rotation player is an energetic veteran with skill like Lingard.
No, but you didn't make that distinction when you generally said 'A year with no no assists, goals...'
His pressing and false runs create trouble for opponents who plays with a high defensive line, making it more likely that we can hit them on the break. How is that not useful?
> His pressing and false runs\n\nThus just a more subtle way of saying work rate. It\u2019s literally the bare minimum for this system. This is what we expect from any player. In things that matter such as passing and finishing, he falls woefully short. He has good energy but his true place in the squad at a top team is 3rd or 4th choice. I doubt any club above 15th place would even take him as a starter
You're the only one mate
No one else in the supporters pub felt he did anything either. Love being down voted as if I talked shit about him.
Fair enough
What was he supposed to do? Run into his leg and get injured. As long as he wasn't rolling around like Neymar or shouting at the ref, he didn't deserve the yellow.
Yeah no doubt there are users who are really well reasoned and I love to read their opinions, one way or the other. But there are other regulars as well who are unreasonable to a point that no rebuttal can change their minds.
>I see no reason to have blind faith\n\nDid you miss the three summer transfers? \n\nI think the issue is with your outlook and the weird selective view that has given you.\n\n>blind faith\n\nwell you are half way with those blinkers on
No I didn't miss it, since I noticed that they got rid of two high profile players without trying to either upgrade or replace them.\n\nIt's great that United finally bought a first choice right back, and Maguire was a good buy. But it has not translated in to points yet, and apparently pointing that out makes me a shit fan.\n\nBut having followed United for 20 years, I should suddenly start being happy with anything.\n\nIf the consensus is that the eternal process that keeps United consistently at sub 70 points is fine, then I guess my standards are too high.
The future is now
\ud83e\udd2b
Sounds tough, she played centre half for Burnley?
#CSKA MOSKVA\n\nFite me.
Ha ha. Yeah. I think shooting practice needs to be next on the agenda.... amazing he is allowed to take some direct freekicks too!
Not Haaland anymore hahaha
Did he actually sign with Juventus then or is he staying?
He will get his chance I'm sure, young won't be in the way of that.\n\nYoung has proved time and time again that there is a space for him in this club.
I\u2019m not saying for a minute I\u2019m not grateful for everything he\u2019s done for United but in my opinion it\u2019s best to just let him go. \n\nWe\u2019ve been too sentimental to certain players and we need to be more ruthless to let Wan Bissaka, Laird, Dalot, Shaw and Williams take over.
I guess you haven't watched this team enough this season. McT is much better at both breaking attacks on the halfway line and keeping the ball. It's Fred's job to play the through balls.\nMatic will get the ball and take too long before passing so he doesn't give the ball away but slows down the attacks.
I've watched 90% of our games this season.\n\n>McT is much better at both breaking attacks on the halfway line and keeping the ball. I\n\nMctominay is probably better at breaking up attacks but he definitely isnt better at keeping the ball. Just look at their overall pass accuracy this season. Matic's passing accuracy is higher.\n\n\n>Matic will get the ball and take too long before passing so he doesn't give the ball away but slows down the attacks.\n\n Idk man matic moved the ball pretty well today and has been moving it well ever since he came back from injury.
This is the time of year which separates the men from the boys.\n\nIf we can keep getting points now we'll be in the race for top 4. That's good enough for me for now.
Arsenal always start well and tail off by the end. Remember they were top of the league at Christmas a few seasons and finished 4th eventually.
Don\u2019t the match-day ones have both teams/date on it?
Yep
Me either, I appreciate the feedback! But like I said, I want one with one of the players on it, which sounds like they aren\u2019t match-day specific. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d want one with both teams on it. \n\nI was calling them match-day scarves because I figured the ones with the players were only sold on match day if I am understanding correctly.\n\nEdit: in other words, I should say scarves that are sold on match-day.  My bad
Nah that\u2019s cool man I totally get it. Like I said originally I\u2019m not trying to be a dick at all.\n\nDm me I\u2019ll try to sort something out for you
Of course, but we play them once more still and nothing would be sweeter than to beat them and end any talk of an invincibles season.
In about 2 years mctominay he will struggle to make our bench and i want you to remember what u/cmonunited said about him \"hes bang average \". He would struggle to get a game for Brighton ffs.
As I said you clearly have an agenda against him, I will take my judgements from those who aren't invested.
I literally said I'd rather we win and I'd rather Ole be successful but that simply isn't going to happen and I'd rather we didn't all bury our heads in the sand and pretend everything is fine. Doing that is exactly how we got here. \n\nOle should've been sacked at the end of last season. He wasn't. As a result this season is virtually wasted. By burying our heads in the sand and pretending what we've seen this season is acceptable when Jose was sacked with LESS points is just ridiculous. We're only close to top 4 because Arsenal shit the bed, Lampard is inexperienced and Mourinho was taking over a shitshow of a spurs side and is a shell of his former self. You really think Ole would be competing with actual elite managers if those clubs had them in charge? We cannot and should not accept what we've gotten this season, if we do then we become more and more like the early 2010s Liverpool. Solskjaer is clearly not good enough and if we pretend like everything is OK and accept anything less than a top 4 finish without sacking him we'll waste next season too.\n\nI'd love him to be a success but he hasn't shown me anything to make me think he will be, Tactically he isn't on the level of even someone like Rodgers. His subs are often poor albeit he has limited materials to work with, he has no idea how to break down a bus, he relies far too much on counter attacking, our defence is bang average despite being a lot better on paper and there is no coherent structure, no plan to break down a defence and no patterns of play worth shit. I can't tell you what our style of  play even is beyond counters?\n\nHe's done some great things. Clearing out the deadwood, 3 good signings, improving Rashford, Scott, Martial, Fred etc. But he will not take us forwards. I hope he is successful but I know he won't be and him leaving is best for everyone. I go into every game wanting us to win but I accept that the manager isn't good enough and should've been sacked by now. The problem with people that are ardent Solskjaer defenders seems to be that many of them assume that wanting a new manager means wanting the club to fail and that you are a plastic, which is a bullshit elitist mentality when I literally said the opposite.
We won against Pep and Mourinho. We started figuring out low block teams, but yet Ole is still not enough for you mouth watering ole out plastics.\n\nAlso, I notice all the Ole out people constantly saying they can't see the tactics we are doing. maybe cause you are just a football fan with FM2019/Fifa 2019 knowledge? This people earned their coaching badges, I am sure they know more tactics then the armchair experts
Shouldn\u2019t be a starter for us neither, I don\u2019t think anyone is claiming that.
I agree. But for the level we aspire to be at, he shouldn\u2019t even be on the bench. Look at the squads of City, Liverpool, Leicester and Chelsea and see if he would even make the bench at those clubs. It\u2019s only because he\u2019s a local lad that he\u2019s survived so long. I don\u2019t hate the guy. I know he cares about the club and tries hard, but when an 18 year old with zero top flight experience before this season has scored more winners than he has, then it definitely is a sign that he needs to leave. Next summer, we should be looking to move on Jones, Rojo, Lingard, and Matic in that order
> are we sure he actually played? Near invisible.
Yes, that's exactly the same as complaining about a poor performance. Cheers for pointing that out. Expert analysis there.
>No I didn't miss it, since I noticed that they got rid of two high profile players without trying to either upgrade or replace them.\n\nlol like replacing Sanchez.  There is a process to go through and some crap to clean up.  3 starting signings is great.  Really absurd that you want Ole out and part of your justification is the summer signings.\n\n>apparently pointing that out makes me a shit fan\n\n>I noticed that they got rid of two high profile players without trying to either upgrade or replace them.\n\nNa it is your your logic and entitlement that is being questioned.  Your blind faith statement is absurdly irrational.\n\n>But having followed United for 20 years, I should suddenly start being happy with anything\n\nAbout 45 years here.  You seem to have an entitlement from watching us from and through the glory years.  I wasn't even part of the SAF (no S then) out brigade.\n\n>If the consensus is that the eternal process that keeps United consistently at sub 70 points is fine, then I guess my standards are too high.\n\nThere is hope that something new can be built now.  Weird you want to cut it off early.\n\nI totally get that how this should have played out is Ole not getting the early contract and then we would have Poch as manager now.  But that isn't what happened and Ole has shown he can sign starting players and deal with the predecessors issues (like loaning out the worst signing in EPL history).
If you said Zenit St. Petersburg my doubts of your MeMaw being Andrey Arshavin would have vanished.
Dortmund
DMed
So? Anyone can beat anyone, its the premier league. I don't see how we've started figuring out low block teams when we just lost to Watford, Burnley and Newcastle also absolutely gifted goals to us and we didn't create hardly any chances against Burnley really.\n\nI'm not a fortune teller, but the guy isn't a miracle worker, the signs aren't there. Call me a plastic all you want but sadly I'll be proven write.
Ole lose: ALL HIS FAULT\n\nOle wins: OPPONENT GAVE US THE WIN\n\nsums up you lot. Gtfo troll
The fact it\u2019s \u201cyou lot\u201d shows the Glazers are winning. We\u2019re all fans, we all want what\u2019s best for the club. We just differ on how to do it.  \n\nIt\u2019s not only oles fault. It\u2019s the boards and players too but only one of those things can be changed immediately
Nah, don't try and do that \"if you support Ole means you support  the glazers\" shit on me.\n\nWe are winning and you still only focus on the negative. Just gtfo. blocked.
I\u2019m not saying you support the Glazers. But they\u2019re trying To lower expectations and they are succeeding. \n\nI\u2019m not focusing on the negative. I\u2019m staying realistic and grounded. There is no point in burying our head in the sand.
 we've kept a clean sheet against a side that us so deadly on set pieces and we've  conceded so many from them. I fucking love this game
Here we go! \u2705
Haaland \u2705
Fuck
Trinidad \u2705 Tobago \u2705
Don't say that name in front of the Americans mate. They're gonna get triggered.
Dwight \u2705 \n\nYorke \u2705
Dirty players, thank god Mike Dean wasn't having none of it.
Fuck Biggie
Add Jon moss, the fat cunt to the list as well.
Where is jon moss?
Getting fucked.
TBF I thought Mike Dean was poor for both sides today. As always.
Probably won't sadly
Couldn't agree more. It's turning into a Hazard situation.
Has to
Yeah, it\u2019s getting absurd. At some point the whole \u201cthey didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d get to the ball!\u201d excise doesn\u2019t cut it.
When you say refs aren\u2019t protecting him do you mean as in they aren\u2019t giving yellows out quick enough for fouls on him? Cheers
Yes. If fouls go unpunished, the ref\u2019s simply enabling another free tactical foul later on that will then take a (later than deserved) yellow, which really isn\u2019t a significant punishment to a defensive team like Burnley that want to break up play and make it a fight.
Yeah at some point you have to put it out there
Lmao
Yeah really not sure why Williams didn't go LM and Shaw LB at the end there
its not like shaw is that much better at defending either, as the watford game showed
Shaw is so fucking fat, motherfucker never moves. So glad Williams played today and showed what the standard for work rate should be for a modern FullBack.
Post a pic of yourself then mate, and a video of you doing 50m sprints
I mean the yellow today was horeshit
He's had a couple needless ones in other games. I love it cause he clearly cares but long term needs to change
Agreed. The commentators said it's his 4th though so he's had 3 more in 4 games.
Can't start every game when you get a yellow in all of them.
Our academy players have been amazing this season, stepping up despite the pressure.
I still prefer Shaw. This was Williams\u2019 best game for us though.
Sadly looks like that's becoming a bit of a habit for him
He's too quick.
Dude runs so fast. Defenders don't have enough time to get out of his way
Pereira was pretty decent. Composed and transitioned the ball well for the most part.
What an assist for the first goal, great press, great composure
Hell, I thought he was great today
Created the first goal on his own
Yeah but pereira sucks. He just isn\u2019t good enough. He never looks up while the ball is at his feet, which means either he gets a lucky assist or the attack fizzles out due to a loss of possession.
Pereira has been playing well in his last few games.
He's been playing better but he makes bonehead mistakes still.
He's playing better but still not enough. Needs to keep improving. Might be another year or 2 until he has a real shout at being someone that can change the game.
Didn't he join in January?
That\u2019s why I thought you meant he had a bad half season. Jan-May.
Tbh I dont rate mctominay at all. I think hes pretty shit and I'd rather play matic over him, especially against sides who sit back. \n\nEdit:He can do a job off the ball but i still think hes one of the worst players on the ball we've ever had.
Yeah everyone to their own and I'm not having a go but I don't really trust your judgement on him as anything more than personal as I people argued with you about him over Fred. I again don't intend to be ignorant.
Particularly in the first 2 months. Rashford missed 2-3 sitters from James.
Man could you imagine if he had been servicing someone like Haaland since the beginning of this season?
That Liverpool game was when I truly appreciated that mentality I hope he inspires everyone else in the squad.
Brandon kept his cool so well too. I would have flipped shit.
Brandon literally flipped.
Seriously, consider it. Mike Dean thought Brandon Williams did a literal front flip at full speed.
He has a tendency to like attention, which is a horrible trait for an official.
Yep, just shit rather than corrupt.
Hanlon\u2019s Razor.
Ya know what I disagree. I think ability wise he is the best ref in england, the problem is he likes to put himself in the spotlight.
I blame the FA years of this they make billions in sponsors and TV deals yet refuse to invest it. Could claim corruption on their part
Williams might give him a run for his money
I don\u2019t think we can use the whole close to top 4 thing as a huge defence of Ole because Spurs, Chelsea and Arsenal are all wank. Leicester are playing at the level a top 4 team should be and we\u2019re still fairly far behind them .
Why do you people even bother watching if all you want is to be #oleout.\n\nIt's like you negative people thrive on us losing just to say 'ole is shit'
Fred and composure. Never thought id see the day
I was thinking that during the game, especially the last 20 minutes. He and matic did well at controlling the tempo when they did receive the ball. Fred in particular made some great outlet passes when he was under pressure. Last year, he would have made some costly mistakes, but today, he was nearly flawless advancing the ball from deep.
It's like when Bruce Banner and The Hulk made up and became friends.
Matic was an absolute necessity in a game like this. Sometimes you just need a giant Serb out there.
Agreed. One thing Matic excels at is using his body to protect the ball and he was excellent at doing that today. That was one of his best performances for us in a long time.
I would say it was his best performance this year
It looked like season 1 matic today.
Matic was incredible. I wrote him off, but he was terrific today and good in the last game.
It's okay, I knocked three times on wood(ward)
Either way Ed is an arse if he doesn\u2019t deliver.\n\nCan\u2019t forget that summer where he basically got Mourinho nothing
Not without signing about 3 players first. He\u2019s not great but can play about 4 different positions between attack and midfield. Imagine Rashford and Martial get injured, we\u2019ll count a on Lingard in that scenario
I wouldn\u2019t mind shipping Lingard , unsure if there are takers that he might be willing to go to. Plus being a Manchester lad he might be kept around
He\u2019s a quality rotation player w high energy and enough skill to make a difference. No reason to ship him now.
He scored and assisted in December
Not in a premier league match, no?
So many that needs to go before him. At least he is useful in some matches.
I feel like you say he is useful but then after every match he gets completely bashed
0 goals and 0 assists in the PL for over a year isn\u2019t exactly useful. His value comes from running around
Yes he had some solid passes to break Burnleys press and unlocked Fred to play with some freedom
Must have been while my pint was blocking the view because I didn't see any of that.
Yea, he did not put a foot wrong tbh. He played like an old school DM, just regulated possession and stayed back to break attacks. He left all the attacking stuuf to Fred and Pereira.
Clattenburg is the one that stands out to me.  Oliver is the only ref who is half competent anymore.
Mature from old Young
Not disagreeing but one thing I\u2019ve noticed about Fred is he always makes himself available for a pass.
Yes but this time fred could pass the ball fowards or to the overlapping williams
Thought rashford looked tired and uncharacteristically uninterested today before his goal. Should've looked to shoot way more.
Looked like they\u2019d close him off anytime he got right outside the box. Made the right choice to pass out and wait for better opportunities
Can confirm.\n\nSource: Me
Matic and Fred ice cool, Ashley Young showing some leadership
Yeah, aside from that one crazy pass to Mata a few matches ago, I think he tries too hard to make worldie passes and that screws him up.
And yes I am getting over-excited. Sue me
Trying not to run into someone at a full sprint and still getting your leg taken out? Nah not having that it was a dive.
You must've not seen the replay from  the back camera angle
In that case I don\u2019t even want to imagine how bad it could be!
WORST MANAGER IN THE LEAGUE
Lol thanks man. That'd be awesome if I could buy the whole team one or two beers lol. I may actually buy a Rashford jersey now haha
Haha yeah that was  unbelievable, lost my voice for a sec lol
I'd really love to know who this magic manager that'll please them is. I've a feeling they'll bitch regardless of who it is.
RW greenwood and James?
Greenwood is a CF for me. I want him to excel there. However, he can be a rotation on that side
Is this talking about us or arsenal?
I'd like to see that but im conflicted because I want arsenal to suffer till the end of the season.
Let's go for a draw then.
Ole has definitely reinstalled the fighting spirit that the team had lost under Mourinho but we still look lost at times. There\u2019s no doubt that the players will never stop running for Ole but what\u2019s our plan other than counter attacking?
One step at the time. It takes time. I am seeing improvments, especially individual ones. Were deadly when counter attacking which we were not before. Our defense is better too. \n\nWith a few midfielders to stabalize the squad I think we will start seeing a lot of improvement. Breaking down defensive teams is quite hard without the needed creativity. Pogba shows that quite well when playing.
That will come with key additions to the squad and also(and probably more importantly) simply through the current squad growing a little bit older and wiser and more used to each other.  \n\nBreaking up bus parking defenses is probably going to be the main focus of next summer's preseason training, or at least it should be.
Is that true? Isn\u2019t there some awful stat about how few points we have won in games where we\u2019ve lost the first goal?
Periera lacking technical quality? Mate, he is probably our second best Attacking midfielder at the moment.
Well because we have only two decent AMs
Hopefully it will remain his task, I don't see a better option, he's got a lot of things right, Ive watched so many dire performances over the last 7 years, but even when we play badly with ole it's a lack of quality.\n\nHes shown against the big boys he's got tactical guile, so I want him to figure it out and improve our squad for the future.
I have also noticed this. I don't know if it's lack of awareness or overconfidence that he can keep the ball despite being pressed. Probay the former as they usually come from behind.
Absolutely. It's very easy to forget these guys get short winded and tired legs. They really came to play today though. Very happy with today. Burnley away isn't easy.
Even argument is always welcome and I agree with what you said. But there are some folks who go into hiding when we win because they are staunchly Ole out. They tend to work OT when we lose.
There are 200 thousand members here. Most of them go into hiding at any given situation. That's not saying much.\n\nSome of us are always here. You know who they are.\n\nThose may be lurkers who interject only when things are extremely good or extremely bad you're talking about. I'd pay more attention to those consistent discussion contributors, than the reactionary ones.
I've literally seen people saying \"This win doesn't mean anything. I still would rather have Poch than Ole\" even after wins. Not every Ole out person is same.
You're saying people are different? Mind blown!\n\nOf course everyone is different, which makes the previous comment and the following comments after the one I made odd. They're each pigeonholing vast swaths of our fanbase. \n\nPoint of note: That quote you bring up makes more sense in a \"bigger picture\" way. Meaning, one win or two wins doesn't matter as much if it's just 1 or 2 wins in 15 games. Just as, if Ole has some amazing wins, especially against the top teams, but overall loses against the majority and ends up mid table or lower, then it wasn't really a good season. And I'd bet those people who said things like that are trying to hedge their bets. Those people think going with Poch will ultimately get United to where they need to go more than Ole can.\n\nI'm not agreeing with that. I personally am not #OLEOUT nor #OLEIN. I like a lot of what Ole brings, and his overall long term plan. If he can pull it off, then awesome. However, he then has to actually successfully carry out his plans. If he talks a good game, but never delivers, then he must go. Unfortunately, by then Poch will be gone.
>But there is no reason to get carried away \n\n... calling for a sacking after a short period of time
I've been very critical of United since Ferguson left, but I rarely if ever comment on sacking managers or any personal.\n\nEven if Ole was hung out to dry in summer, I don't think this is good enough. I may just have gotten cynical, but the current squad has not given me a reason to change my opinion yet.\n\nIf they keep up the results until the end of the season, then I'll happily eat my words, there are 54 points up for grasp so plenty could change, but until they do, I see no reason to have blind faith that all will change.
Go root for another team.
Absolutely. Would also like to start Pereira over Lingard any day of the week. He did quite well.
Lingard can just press.  That's all
And sucks that Brandon got carded for getting tackled.
Maybe but he wasn't giving as much effort and he looked slow. Feel like he didn't trust his legs when he bottled that chance on goal as well.
He has on multiple occasions
Potential future club captain!
Isn't that McTominay, ideally?
It's tough,to me it seems like he dives over the outstretched leg to avoid contact. He could have hit the leg and taken the hit but tried to avoid it. Either way I feel like the defender was at fault for making a dangerous situation
He got a yellow for what Dean thought was a dive.
Fuck Mike Dean
It was  a clear dive, did you see the replay?
Every time he goes down like that I fear for his career. And every time he gets back up I am left dumbfounded!
I love both Tonys all the same \ud83d\ude05
Hmmm I have never seen the two in the same room at the same time.
Without pogba and awb
Traore playing like a Valencia regen. Absolute unit.
Man United can kidnap Mikel Arteta, and give Mata to disguise as Mikel Arteta.
alright hahahah
My MeMaw can Cantona kick the dentures down your MeMaw's mouth.
My MeMaw is a Bare Breasted Marauder who two foots man city players for breakfast.
his passing surely has to be contending for the best in the PL among centerbacks
We were level on points with newcastle when we played them??
And Burnley are level with Arsenal at the moment...
Just a few days ago everyone was lamenting our inability to beat the lower teams lol. Funny how quick the narrative changes for some people.
could say that for watford,newcastle,bouremouth,southampton and etc
[deleted]
Because it's stupid and incorrect? Burnley and Newcastle have same or more points than Arsenal.
It\u2019d be great if he could chip in 5 goals a season or something. Something we are sorely missing outside of Pogba.
Yea for sure but alas every time I see his eyes light up in front of goal I think it's time to put the kettle on.
Sorry have to give it to Harry.\n\nImagine who else would play in CB now
Sorry I give that to Grealish/Haaland/Havertz/Sancho, because they\u2019re coming to us this season
We have 2 contenders for signing of the season. Is this a simulation??
Fred 2 Electric Bugaloo for me.
never thought this day would come
I'm not worried about Williams. He's like mcsauce. It's usually him that fucks other people up.
Speaks more to the nature of this sub and how they scapegoat rather than the truth of Young's strengths and abilities.
very true
He doesn't even need to play every game you wet fart
The problem isn't that he is playing every single game. The problem is we have too many players that will put in an unpredictable performance. Young, Mata, Lingard, Pereira are all easy shouts.. At their best, they can hold their own. At their worst, they're unbelievably poor.
I\u2019d rather give Ethan Laird a shot at right back. One decent performance and it\u2019s lets keep Young, if he got an extension this sub would go into meltdown. \n\nHe\u2019s part of the deadwood, thanks for the memories but goodbye.
while he slipped on the ground.
Goal of the season contender that.
Can Arsenal please turn up tomorrow?
Slide \u00a320m to Everton to 2-foot Liverpool's entire XI with their rotation players, then an extra \u00a310m to 20 foot Van Dijk for good measure
Greenwood almost guarantees a goal a game. I'd start him on the right
I think it\u2019s the other way around, let Greenwood start, bag a banger and then unleash a fully rested James on a tired Mustafi
That almost makes them a top 6 team
He had a good game but the dive was disappointing.
You see a dive i see a player get kicked and trying to have his legs not broke
Poor reffing. He's plainly kicked in the thigh, but Dean doesn't want to send off Bardsley.
Just goes to show majority of us (including me) knows fuck all about football
We've had no problem beating world class teams, have we?
Same, wouldn\u2019t count on Arsenal beating Chelsea tbh, but hey they\u2019re both shit so who knows.
Y
should have 1-2 reds atleast tbf fuck mike dean stupid ugly bald cunt
What? Matic is the slowest one on the ball in that midfield. Always takes 2 3 more touches than he should
I thought he moved the ball pretty well today. mctominay passes the ball to the opponents under no pressure about 5 times a game .
If you had set Matic is better than McTominay in games like this against the low block, I would agree.
That's exactly what I'm proposing. Against the bus parkers play matic and against the sides that will dominate us play mctominay.
Don't know why you are being down voted. Against low block, he is decent.
Mctominay is the most protected player on this sub lmao
A destroyer in every sense of the word, lmao

Bahahaha. Brutal. Accurate...but brutal.

One bad game and everybody will have his head. I think he should go if we get a replacement because he's already declining and isn't fit for a fast paced league anymore
If he's fine playing a bit part role, I'd have him tollthe end of the season. It's going to be hard getting anyone of real quality to join our midfield in January, so with what we have, matic will provide an extra bit of experience. I hope
Crumpsall \ud83d\ude4c
True. Forgot about that.
And none of them worked! I was waiting for one of them to leak out but we were a wall today.
Draw is the best result and 7 red cards
They NEVER miss an opportunity to bring it up. Lmaoo
I know I know. It\u2019s so good seeing us play with some identity though, only a few players letting us down now instead of the whole team
Yeah earned win today
Saved
That one burns and I'm a United fan
It\u2019s happ-y en-d-ing!
I think he\u2019s scored enough with the left foot. His right deserves a chance now
Or maybe he'll score a RVP-esque flying Dutchman world cup goal with a cross coming in from AWB
Shaw is just as vulnerable as hes is slow getting back,  with Brandon he adjusts where as Shaw is always jogging back slowly
100% agere. Williams will be a starting player in the future, but he does like safe passing a lot.
Fred and mctominay are box to box players, they have done well there but imo a defensive mid alongside Fred will make him much better
I know that, but Fred\u2019s filled in excellently. Matic will get caught out more against more technical and pacy teams.\n\nBurnley played long ball, physical football. Played right into Matic\u2019s hands.
If you don\u2019t foul him, what can you do? If he gets a yard on you, you\u2019re not getting it back.
Granted, but the amount of spikes and hip checks he\u2019s taking are ridiculous.
It was ridiculous the amount of fouls on the poor kid the dreadful ref just let go. Stupid horrible ref.
agreed, could've been multiple called
Thanks tor speaking up and knowing what this club is!
Thanks and same to you, too many fans seem to miss the point glad there are enough fans who see the big picture too.
Lol!!!! Sad
Beating the poor teams is what we struggle at though ...
Are you ever happy
Gtfo plastic boy
Beat the top teams and its it doesn't matter unless we beat the lower teams, beat the lower teams and it's yeah but theyre shit lol...
> James is the better option against a Top 6 club\n\nHe was talking about Arsenal
crazy how we were 14th at one point and now were 7 points clear of them lol
Loved it. Pace of pass was good
Totally understand. Are the ones with players on them match day specific though? I legitimately don\u2019t know. I think they\u2019re awesome though. I\u2019m calling those  match-day scarves because I don\u2019t see them available on the United store ever. I\u2019d love to have one with Rashford, Martial, or De Gea on it.
They aren\u2019t match day specific. There is match day specific ones but the ones you\u2019re mentioning aren\u2019t.
They\u2019re not going to be on the store because they\u2019re sold by locals. No idea why I\u2019m getting downvoted and couldn\u2019t give a fuck but I\u2019m not wrong.\n\nI think it\u2019s odd that you\u2019d want a memento of a game you didn\u2019t go to, but hey, you do you.
I live in Singapore, trust me if I could attend every single MUFC game, I would. That makes me less of a fan? Would you stay up till 4 in the morning JUST to watch United? Even now?
Real class, so because you get to live near OUR team and attend the games frequently, you're better than a fellow dedicated fan from the other side of the world. Fuck you 3000!\nI live in the states and would give my left ball to be at Old Trafford for one game. ANY GAME.
[removed]

It's about damn time.
cheers
nice to see someone answer honestly lol.
Lol
It\u2019s a meme from a few seasons ago
it was tight because of his first touch
Yeah he should have whacked it with his left.
He\u2019s still not close to good enough in pretty much any game.
Just lol at the excuses you guys keep making for him.
No, it has to be from my own pocket. Sacrifices must be made.
Agreed! Rashford been our best player this season
Thanks, could never understand it
He is not.
Not against Shaw completely but he\u2019s only gotten worse when it comes to his attacking contribution. Him against Newcastle on Boxing Day vs Williams today were night and day
Arsenal win would be good too, I just don\u2019t have faith of them being able to do anything, they\u2019re awful. Meh no one is going to catch Liverpool, Leicester choked when they needed to show something.
I\u2019ve accepted Pool winning the league, still don\u2019t want them to end undefeated or with a record tally or anything.
Look we all hate Pool, but we need to be realistic, better to have the teams around us dropping points to solidify at least a 5th place showing for the time being. Don\u2019t let your hate blind you, United first.
GGMU
Oops Sean gets it from the worms that he eats daily.
Isn\u2019t that how CR7 got his crazy goal record?
Just twerking for Jose for when transfer window opens
Cheeky swap for Son, worth it worth it.
He was still replaced by someone
Ole out group are on sucide watch
well ackshually I don't get invited to parties. so there. Also, it was a joke playing on our record of winning vs top 6, not picking up as many points against teams below us... Maybe you didn't hear me properly?
> *ackshually*
Literally shaking rn
You\u2019re ignoring his contributions out of possession and his dead ball ability.
I've been one of his biggest critics but there has been a serious up turn in his displays recently. Not saying he is starting or even squad quality for the long run but he has certainly upped his game.
I think my criticism of mctominay is pretty fair. I've always said that he has a good defensive workrate which is useful against teams who dominate us but when it's time to play against teams who hand us possession hes one of the reasons we struggle to break down teams. His passing is genuinely shocking and I'm not sure I've seen a United midfielder as bad as him with the ball at his feet. I always compare mctominay to fred because I want people to realise what proper united quality midfielder looks like.
Nah, like your comments on him purely reek of personal vendetta due to internet arguments
I want what is best for the club and Ole leaving is what is best for the club. I'd rather we win and Ole be successful but we will never win a league title with him in charge.
> I want what is best for the club and Ole leaving is what is best for the  club. I'd rather we win and Ole be successful but we will never win a  league title with him in charge. \n\nu/mrpiggywinkles52, So you are admitting you want us to lose just so Ole gets the sacked?\n\nPlastic.
What\u2019s the benchmark for \u201cquality rotation player\u201d?  No goals or assists in a year is abysmal
Quality rotation player is an energetic veteran with skill like Lingard.
No, but you didn't make that distinction when you generally said 'A year with no no assists, goals...'
His pressing and false runs create trouble for opponents who plays with a high defensive line, making it more likely that we can hit them on the break. How is that not useful?
> His pressing and false runs\n\nThus just a more subtle way of saying work rate. It\u2019s literally the bare minimum for this system. This is what we expect from any player. In things that matter such as passing and finishing, he falls woefully short. He has good energy but his true place in the squad at a top team is 3rd or 4th choice. I doubt any club above 15th place would even take him as a starter
You're the only one mate
No one else in the supporters pub felt he did anything either. Love being down voted as if I talked shit about him.
Fair enough
What was he supposed to do? Run into his leg and get injured. As long as he wasn't rolling around like Neymar or shouting at the ref, he didn't deserve the yellow.
Yeah no doubt there are users who are really well reasoned and I love to read their opinions, one way or the other. But there are other regulars as well who are unreasonable to a point that no rebuttal can change their minds.
>I see no reason to have blind faith\n\nDid you miss the three summer transfers? \n\nI think the issue is with your outlook and the weird selective view that has given you.\n\n>blind faith\n\nwell you are half way with those blinkers on
No I didn't miss it, since I noticed that they got rid of two high profile players without trying to either upgrade or replace them.\n\nIt's great that United finally bought a first choice right back, and Maguire was a good buy. But it has not translated in to points yet, and apparently pointing that out makes me a shit fan.\n\nBut having followed United for 20 years, I should suddenly start being happy with anything.\n\nIf the consensus is that the eternal process that keeps United consistently at sub 70 points is fine, then I guess my standards are too high.
The future is now
\ud83e\udd2b
Sounds tough, she played centre half for Burnley?
#CSKA MOSKVA\n\nFite me.
Ha ha. Yeah. I think shooting practice needs to be next on the agenda.... amazing he is allowed to take some direct freekicks too!
Not Haaland anymore hahaha
Did he actually sign with Juventus then or is he staying?
He will get his chance I'm sure, young won't be in the way of that.\n\nYoung has proved time and time again that there is a space for him in this club.
I\u2019m not saying for a minute I\u2019m not grateful for everything he\u2019s done for United but in my opinion it\u2019s best to just let him go. \n\nWe\u2019ve been too sentimental to certain players and we need to be more ruthless to let Wan Bissaka, Laird, Dalot, Shaw and Williams take over.
I guess you haven't watched this team enough this season. McT is much better at both breaking attacks on the halfway line and keeping the ball. It's Fred's job to play the through balls.\nMatic will get the ball and take too long before passing so he doesn't give the ball away but slows down the attacks.
I've watched 90% of our games this season.\n\n>McT is much better at both breaking attacks on the halfway line and keeping the ball. I\n\nMctominay is probably better at breaking up attacks but he definitely isnt better at keeping the ball. Just look at their overall pass accuracy this season. Matic's passing accuracy is higher.\n\n\n>Matic will get the ball and take too long before passing so he doesn't give the ball away but slows down the attacks.\n\n Idk man matic moved the ball pretty well today and has been moving it well ever since he came back from injury.
This is the time of year which separates the men from the boys.\n\nIf we can keep getting points now we'll be in the race for top 4. That's good enough for me for now.
Arsenal always start well and tail off by the end. Remember they were top of the league at Christmas a few seasons and finished 4th eventually.
Don\u2019t the match-day ones have both teams/date on it?
Yep
Me either, I appreciate the feedback! But like I said, I want one with one of the players on it, which sounds like they aren\u2019t match-day specific. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d want one with both teams on it. \n\nI was calling them match-day scarves because I figured the ones with the players were only sold on match day if I am understanding correctly.\n\nEdit: in other words, I should say scarves that are sold on match-day.  My bad
Nah that\u2019s cool man I totally get it. Like I said originally I\u2019m not trying to be a dick at all.\n\nDm me I\u2019ll try to sort something out for you
Of course, but we play them once more still and nothing would be sweeter than to beat them and end any talk of an invincibles season.
In about 2 years mctominay he will struggle to make our bench and i want you to remember what u/cmonunited said about him \"hes bang average \". He would struggle to get a game for Brighton ffs.
As I said you clearly have an agenda against him, I will take my judgements from those who aren't invested.
I literally said I'd rather we win and I'd rather Ole be successful but that simply isn't going to happen and I'd rather we didn't all bury our heads in the sand and pretend everything is fine. Doing that is exactly how we got here. \n\nOle should've been sacked at the end of last season. He wasn't. As a result this season is virtually wasted. By burying our heads in the sand and pretending what we've seen this season is acceptable when Jose was sacked with LESS points is just ridiculous. We're only close to top 4 because Arsenal shit the bed, Lampard is inexperienced and Mourinho was taking over a shitshow of a spurs side and is a shell of his former self. You really think Ole would be competing with actual elite managers if those clubs had them in charge? We cannot and should not accept what we've gotten this season, if we do then we become more and more like the early 2010s Liverpool. Solskjaer is clearly not good enough and if we pretend like everything is OK and accept anything less than a top 4 finish without sacking him we'll waste next season too.\n\nI'd love him to be a success but he hasn't shown me anything to make me think he will be, Tactically he isn't on the level of even someone like Rodgers. His subs are often poor albeit he has limited materials to work with, he has no idea how to break down a bus, he relies far too much on counter attacking, our defence is bang average despite being a lot better on paper and there is no coherent structure, no plan to break down a defence and no patterns of play worth shit. I can't tell you what our style of  play even is beyond counters?\n\nHe's done some great things. Clearing out the deadwood, 3 good signings, improving Rashford, Scott, Martial, Fred etc. But he will not take us forwards. I hope he is successful but I know he won't be and him leaving is best for everyone. I go into every game wanting us to win but I accept that the manager isn't good enough and should've been sacked by now. The problem with people that are ardent Solskjaer defenders seems to be that many of them assume that wanting a new manager means wanting the club to fail and that you are a plastic, which is a bullshit elitist mentality when I literally said the opposite.
We won against Pep and Mourinho. We started figuring out low block teams, but yet Ole is still not enough for you mouth watering ole out plastics.\n\nAlso, I notice all the Ole out people constantly saying they can't see the tactics we are doing. maybe cause you are just a football fan with FM2019/Fifa 2019 knowledge? This people earned their coaching badges, I am sure they know more tactics then the armchair experts
Shouldn\u2019t be a starter for us neither, I don\u2019t think anyone is claiming that.
I agree. But for the level we aspire to be at, he shouldn\u2019t even be on the bench. Look at the squads of City, Liverpool, Leicester and Chelsea and see if he would even make the bench at those clubs. It\u2019s only because he\u2019s a local lad that he\u2019s survived so long. I don\u2019t hate the guy. I know he cares about the club and tries hard, but when an 18 year old with zero top flight experience before this season has scored more winners than he has, then it definitely is a sign that he needs to leave. Next summer, we should be looking to move on Jones, Rojo, Lingard, and Matic in that order
> are we sure he actually played? Near invisible.
Yes, that's exactly the same as complaining about a poor performance. Cheers for pointing that out. Expert analysis there.
>No I didn't miss it, since I noticed that they got rid of two high profile players without trying to either upgrade or replace them.\n\nlol like replacing Sanchez.  There is a process to go through and some crap to clean up.  3 starting signings is great.  Really absurd that you want Ole out and part of your justification is the summer signings.\n\n>apparently pointing that out makes me a shit fan\n\n>I noticed that they got rid of two high profile players without trying to either upgrade or replace them.\n\nNa it is your your logic and entitlement that is being questioned.  Your blind faith statement is absurdly irrational.\n\n>But having followed United for 20 years, I should suddenly start being happy with anything\n\nAbout 45 years here.  You seem to have an entitlement from watching us from and through the glory years.  I wasn't even part of the SAF (no S then) out brigade.\n\n>If the consensus is that the eternal process that keeps United consistently at sub 70 points is fine, then I guess my standards are too high.\n\nThere is hope that something new can be built now.  Weird you want to cut it off early.\n\nI totally get that how this should have played out is Ole not getting the early contract and then we would have Poch as manager now.  But that isn't what happened and Ole has shown he can sign starting players and deal with the predecessors issues (like loaning out the worst signing in EPL history).
If you said Zenit St. Petersburg my doubts of your MeMaw being Andrey Arshavin would have vanished.
Dortmund
DMed
So? Anyone can beat anyone, its the premier league. I don't see how we've started figuring out low block teams when we just lost to Watford, Burnley and Newcastle also absolutely gifted goals to us and we didn't create hardly any chances against Burnley really.\n\nI'm not a fortune teller, but the guy isn't a miracle worker, the signs aren't there. Call me a plastic all you want but sadly I'll be proven write.
Ole lose: ALL HIS FAULT\n\nOle wins: OPPONENT GAVE US THE WIN\n\nsums up you lot. Gtfo troll
The fact it\u2019s \u201cyou lot\u201d shows the Glazers are winning. We\u2019re all fans, we all want what\u2019s best for the club. We just differ on how to do it.  \n\nIt\u2019s not only oles fault. It\u2019s the boards and players too but only one of those things can be changed immediately
Nah, don't try and do that \"if you support Ole means you support  the glazers\" shit on me.\n\nWe are winning and you still only focus on the negative. Just gtfo. blocked.
I\u2019m not saying you support the Glazers. But they\u2019re trying To lower expectations and they are succeeding. \n\nI\u2019m not focusing on the negative. I\u2019m staying realistic and grounded. There is no point in burying our head in the sand.
De Ligt \u2705
Here we go! \u2705
Haaland \u2705
Trinidad \u2705 Tobago \u2705
Don't say that name in front of the Americans mate. They're gonna get triggered.
Dwight \u2705 \n\nYorke \u2705
Dirty players, thank god Mike Dean wasn't having none of it.
Fuck Biggie
Add Jon moss, the fat cunt to the list as well.
Where is jon moss?
Getting fucked.
TBF I thought Mike Dean was poor for both sides today. As always.
Probably won't sadly
Couldn't agree more. It's turning into a Hazard situation.
Has to
Yeah, it\u2019s getting absurd. At some point the whole \u201cthey didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d get to the ball!\u201d excise doesn\u2019t cut it.
When you say refs aren\u2019t protecting him do you mean as in they aren\u2019t giving yellows out quick enough for fouls on him? Cheers
Yes. If fouls go unpunished, the ref\u2019s simply enabling another free tactical foul later on that will then take a (later than deserved) yellow, which really isn\u2019t a significant punishment to a defensive team like Burnley that want to break up play and make it a fight.
Yeah at some point you have to put it out there
Lmao
Yeah really not sure why Williams didn't go LM and Shaw LB at the end there
its not like shaw is that much better at defending either, as the watford game showed
Shaw is so fucking fat, motherfucker never moves. So glad Williams played today and showed what the standard for work rate should be for a modern FullBack.
Post a pic of yourself then mate, and a video of you doing 50m sprints
I mean the yellow today was horeshit
He's had a couple needless ones in other games. I love it cause he clearly cares but long term needs to change
Agreed. The commentators said it's his 4th though so he's had 3 more in 4 games.
Can't start every game when you get a yellow in all of them.
Our academy players have been amazing this season, stepping up despite the pressure.
I still prefer Shaw. This was Williams\u2019 best game for us though.
Sadly looks like that's becoming a bit of a habit for him
He's too quick.
Dude runs so fast. Defenders don't have enough time to get out of his way
Pereira was pretty decent. Composed and transitioned the ball well for the most part.
What an assist for the first goal, great press, great composure
Hell, I thought he was great today
Created the first goal on his own
Yeah but pereira sucks. He just isn\u2019t good enough. He never looks up while the ball is at his feet, which means either he gets a lucky assist or the attack fizzles out due to a loss of possession.
Pereira has been playing well in his last few games.
He's been playing better but he makes bonehead mistakes still.
He's playing better but still not enough. Needs to keep improving. Might be another year or 2 until he has a real shout at being someone that can change the game.
Didn't he join in January?
That\u2019s why I thought you meant he had a bad half season. Jan-May.
Tbh I dont rate mctominay at all. I think hes pretty shit and I'd rather play matic over him, especially against sides who sit back. \n\nEdit:He can do a job off the ball but i still think hes one of the worst players on the ball we've ever had.
Yeah everyone to their own and I'm not having a go but I don't really trust your judgement on him as anything more than personal as I people argued with you about him over Fred. I again don't intend to be ignorant.
Particularly in the first 2 months. Rashford missed 2-3 sitters from James.
Man could you imagine if he had been servicing someone like Haaland since the beginning of this season?
That Liverpool game was when I truly appreciated that mentality I hope he inspires everyone else in the squad.
Brandon kept his cool so well too. I would have flipped shit.
Brandon literally flipped.
Seriously, consider it. Mike Dean thought Brandon Williams did a literal front flip at full speed.
He has a tendency to like attention, which is a horrible trait for an official.
Yep, just shit rather than corrupt.
Hanlon\u2019s Razor.
Ya know what I disagree. I think ability wise he is the best ref in england, the problem is he likes to put himself in the spotlight.
I blame the FA years of this they make billions in sponsors and TV deals yet refuse to invest it. Could claim corruption on their part
Williams might give him a run for his money
I don\u2019t think we can use the whole close to top 4 thing as a huge defence of Ole because Spurs, Chelsea and Arsenal are all wank. Leicester are playing at the level a top 4 team should be and we\u2019re still fairly far behind them .
Why do you people even bother watching if all you want is to be #oleout.\n\nIt's like you negative people thrive on us losing just to say 'ole is shit'
Fred and composure. Never thought id see the day
I was thinking that during the game, especially the last 20 minutes. He and matic did well at controlling the tempo when they did receive the ball. Fred in particular made some great outlet passes when he was under pressure. Last year, he would have made some costly mistakes, but today, he was nearly flawless advancing the ball from deep.
It's like when Bruce Banner and The Hulk made up and became friends.
Matic was an absolute necessity in a game like this. Sometimes you just need a giant Serb out there.
Agreed. One thing Matic excels at is using his body to protect the ball and he was excellent at doing that today. That was one of his best performances for us in a long time.
I would say it was his best performance this year
It looked like season 1 matic today.
Matic was incredible. I wrote him off, but he was terrific today and good in the last game.
It's okay, I knocked three times on wood(ward)
Either way Ed is an arse if he doesn\u2019t deliver.\n\nCan\u2019t forget that summer where he basically got Mourinho nothing
Not without signing about 3 players first. He\u2019s not great but can play about 4 different positions between attack and midfield. Imagine Rashford and Martial get injured, we\u2019ll count a on Lingard in that scenario
I wouldn\u2019t mind shipping Lingard , unsure if there are takers that he might be willing to go to. Plus being a Manchester lad he might be kept around
He\u2019s a quality rotation player w high energy and enough skill to make a difference. No reason to ship him now.
He scored and assisted in December
Not in a premier league match, no?
So many that needs to go before him. At least he is useful in some matches.
I feel like you say he is useful but then after every match he gets completely bashed
0 goals and 0 assists in the PL for over a year isn\u2019t exactly useful. His value comes from running around
Yes he had some solid passes to break Burnleys press and unlocked Fred to play with some freedom
Must have been while my pint was blocking the view because I didn't see any of that.
Yea, he did not put a foot wrong tbh. He played like an old school DM, just regulated possession and stayed back to break attacks. He left all the attacking stuuf to Fred and Pereira.
Clattenburg is the one that stands out to me.  Oliver is the only ref who is half competent anymore.
Mature from old Young
Not disagreeing but one thing I\u2019ve noticed about Fred is he always makes himself available for a pass.
Yes but this time fred could pass the ball fowards or to the overlapping williams
Thought rashford looked tired and uncharacteristically uninterested today before his goal. Should've looked to shoot way more.
Looked like they\u2019d close him off anytime he got right outside the box. Made the right choice to pass out and wait for better opportunities
Can confirm.\n\nSource: Me
Matic and Fred ice cool, Ashley Young showing some leadership
Yeah, aside from that one crazy pass to Mata a few matches ago, I think he tries too hard to make worldie passes and that screws him up.
And yes I am getting over-excited. Sue me
Trying not to run into someone at a full sprint and still getting your leg taken out? Nah not having that it was a dive.
You must've not seen the replay from  the back camera angle
In that case I don\u2019t even want to imagine how bad it could be!
WORST MANAGER IN THE LEAGUE
Lol thanks man. That'd be awesome if I could buy the whole team one or two beers lol. I may actually buy a Rashford jersey now haha
Haha yeah that was  unbelievable, lost my voice for a sec lol
I'd really love to know who this magic manager that'll please them is. I've a feeling they'll bitch regardless of who it is.
RW greenwood and James?
Greenwood is a CF for me. I want him to excel there. However, he can be a rotation on that side
Is this talking about us or arsenal?
I'd like to see that but im conflicted because I want arsenal to suffer till the end of the season.
Let's go for a draw then.
Ole has definitely reinstalled the fighting spirit that the team had lost under Mourinho but we still look lost at times. There\u2019s no doubt that the players will never stop running for Ole but what\u2019s our plan other than counter attacking?
One step at the time. It takes time. I am seeing improvments, especially individual ones. Were deadly when counter attacking which we were not before. Our defense is better too. \n\nWith a few midfielders to stabalize the squad I think we will start seeing a lot of improvement. Breaking down defensive teams is quite hard without the needed creativity. Pogba shows that quite well when playing.
That will come with key additions to the squad and also(and probably more importantly) simply through the current squad growing a little bit older and wiser and more used to each other.  \n\nBreaking up bus parking defenses is probably going to be the main focus of next summer's preseason training, or at least it should be.
Is that true? Isn\u2019t there some awful stat about how few points we have won in games where we\u2019ve lost the first goal?
Periera lacking technical quality? Mate, he is probably our second best Attacking midfielder at the moment.
Well because we have only two decent AMs
Hopefully it will remain his task, I don't see a better option, he's got a lot of things right, Ive watched so many dire performances over the last 7 years, but even when we play badly with ole it's a lack of quality.\n\nHes shown against the big boys he's got tactical guile, so I want him to figure it out and improve our squad for the future.
I have also noticed this. I don't know if it's lack of awareness or overconfidence that he can keep the ball despite being pressed. Probay the former as they usually come from behind.
Absolutely. It's very easy to forget these guys get short winded and tired legs. They really came to play today though. Very happy with today. Burnley away isn't easy.
Even argument is always welcome and I agree with what you said. But there are some folks who go into hiding when we win because they are staunchly Ole out. They tend to work OT when we lose.
There are 200 thousand members here. Most of them go into hiding at any given situation. That's not saying much.\n\nSome of us are always here. You know who they are.\n\nThose may be lurkers who interject only when things are extremely good or extremely bad you're talking about. I'd pay more attention to those consistent discussion contributors, than the reactionary ones.
I've literally seen people saying \"This win doesn't mean anything. I still would rather have Poch than Ole\" even after wins. Not every Ole out person is same.
You're saying people are different? Mind blown!\n\nOf course everyone is different, which makes the previous comment and the following comments after the one I made odd. They're each pigeonholing vast swaths of our fanbase. \n\nPoint of note: That quote you bring up makes more sense in a \"bigger picture\" way. Meaning, one win or two wins doesn't matter as much if it's just 1 or 2 wins in 15 games. Just as, if Ole has some amazing wins, especially against the top teams, but overall loses against the majority and ends up mid table or lower, then it wasn't really a good season. And I'd bet those people who said things like that are trying to hedge their bets. Those people think going with Poch will ultimately get United to where they need to go more than Ole can.\n\nI'm not agreeing with that. I personally am not #OLEOUT nor #OLEIN. I like a lot of what Ole brings, and his overall long term plan. If he can pull it off, then awesome. However, he then has to actually successfully carry out his plans. If he talks a good game, but never delivers, then he must go. Unfortunately, by then Poch will be gone.
>But there is no reason to get carried away \n\n... calling for a sacking after a short period of time
I've been very critical of United since Ferguson left, but I rarely if ever comment on sacking managers or any personal.\n\nEven if Ole was hung out to dry in summer, I don't think this is good enough. I may just have gotten cynical, but the current squad has not given me a reason to change my opinion yet.\n\nIf they keep up the results until the end of the season, then I'll happily eat my words, there are 54 points up for grasp so plenty could change, but until they do, I see no reason to have blind faith that all will change.
Go root for another team.
Absolutely. Would also like to start Pereira over Lingard any day of the week. He did quite well.
Lingard can just press.  That's all
And sucks that Brandon got carded for getting tackled.
Maybe but he wasn't giving as much effort and he looked slow. Feel like he didn't trust his legs when he bottled that chance on goal as well.
He has on multiple occasions
Potential future club captain!
Isn't that McTominay, ideally?
It's tough,to me it seems like he dives over the outstretched leg to avoid contact. He could have hit the leg and taken the hit but tried to avoid it. Either way I feel like the defender was at fault for making a dangerous situation
He got a yellow for what Dean thought was a dive.
Fuck Mike Dean
It was  a clear dive, did you see the replay?
Every time he goes down like that I fear for his career. And every time he gets back up I am left dumbfounded!
I love both Tonys all the same \ud83d\ude05
Hmmm I have never seen the two in the same room at the same time.
Without pogba and awb
Traore playing like a Valencia regen. Absolute unit.
Man United can kidnap Mikel Arteta, and give Mata to disguise as Mikel Arteta.
alright hahahah
My MeMaw can Cantona kick the dentures down your MeMaw's mouth.
My MeMaw is a Bare Breasted Marauder who two foots man city players for breakfast.
his passing surely has to be contending for the best in the PL among centerbacks
We were level on points with newcastle when we played them??
And Burnley are level with Arsenal at the moment...
Just a few days ago everyone was lamenting our inability to beat the lower teams lol. Funny how quick the narrative changes for some people.
could say that for watford,newcastle,bouremouth,southampton and etc
[deleted]
Because it's stupid and incorrect? Burnley and Newcastle have same or more points than Arsenal.
It\u2019d be great if he could chip in 5 goals a season or something. Something we are sorely missing outside of Pogba.
Yea for sure but alas every time I see his eyes light up in front of goal I think it's time to put the kettle on.
Sorry have to give it to Harry.\n\nImagine who else would play in CB now
Sorry I give that to Grealish/Haaland/Havertz/Sancho, because they\u2019re coming to us this season
We have 2 contenders for signing of the season. Is this a simulation??
Fred 2 Electric Bugaloo for me.
never thought this day would come
I'm not worried about Williams. He's like mcsauce. It's usually him that fucks other people up.
Speaks more to the nature of this sub and how they scapegoat rather than the truth of Young's strengths and abilities.
very true
He doesn't even need to play every game you wet fart
The problem isn't that he is playing every single game. The problem is we have too many players that will put in an unpredictable performance. Young, Mata, Lingard, Pereira are all easy shouts.. At their best, they can hold their own. At their worst, they're unbelievably poor.
I\u2019d rather give Ethan Laird a shot at right back. One decent performance and it\u2019s lets keep Young, if he got an extension this sub would go into meltdown. \n\nHe\u2019s part of the deadwood, thanks for the memories but goodbye.
while he slipped on the ground.
Goal of the season contender that.
Can Arsenal please turn up tomorrow?
Slide \u00a320m to Everton to 2-foot Liverpool's entire XI with their rotation players, then an extra \u00a310m to 20 foot Van Dijk for good measure
Greenwood almost guarantees a goal a game. I'd start him on the right
I think it\u2019s the other way around, let Greenwood start, bag a banger and then unleash a fully rested James on a tired Mustafi
That almost makes them a top 6 team
He had a good game but the dive was disappointing.
You see a dive i see a player get kicked and trying to have his legs not broke
Poor reffing. He's plainly kicked in the thigh, but Dean doesn't want to send off Bardsley.
Just goes to show majority of us (including me) knows fuck all about football
We've had no problem beating world class teams, have we?
Same, wouldn\u2019t count on Arsenal beating Chelsea tbh, but hey they\u2019re both shit so who knows.
Y
should have 1-2 reds atleast tbf fuck mike dean stupid ugly bald cunt
What? Matic is the slowest one on the ball in that midfield. Always takes 2 3 more touches than he should
I thought he moved the ball pretty well today. mctominay passes the ball to the opponents under no pressure about 5 times a game .
If you had set Matic is better than McTominay in games like this against the low block, I would agree.
That's exactly what I'm proposing. Against the bus parkers play matic and against the sides that will dominate us play mctominay.
Don't know why you are being down voted. Against low block, he is decent.
Mctominay is the most protected player on this sub lmao
A destroyer in every sense of the word, lmao
r/angryupvote
Bahahaha. Brutal. Accurate...but brutal.
\ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02
One bad game and everybody will have his head. I think he should go if we get a replacement because he's already declining and isn't fit for a fast paced league anymore
If he's fine playing a bit part role, I'd have him tollthe end of the season. It's going to be hard getting anyone of real quality to join our midfield in January, so with what we have, matic will provide an extra bit of experience. I hope
Crumpsall \ud83d\ude4c
True. Forgot about that.
And none of them worked! I was waiting for one of them to leak out but we were a wall today.
Draw is the best result and 7 red cards
They NEVER miss an opportunity to bring it up. Lmaoo
I know I know. It\u2019s so good seeing us play with some identity though, only a few players letting us down now instead of the whole team
Yeah earned win today
Saved
That one burns and I'm a United fan
It\u2019s happ-y en-d-ing!
I think he\u2019s scored enough with the left foot. His right deserves a chance now
Or maybe he'll score a RVP-esque flying Dutchman world cup goal with a cross coming in from AWB
Shaw is just as vulnerable as hes is slow getting back,  with Brandon he adjusts where as Shaw is always jogging back slowly
100% agere. Williams will be a starting player in the future, but he does like safe passing a lot.
Fred and mctominay are box to box players, they have done well there but imo a defensive mid alongside Fred will make him much better
I know that, but Fred\u2019s filled in excellently. Matic will get caught out more against more technical and pacy teams.\n\nBurnley played long ball, physical football. Played right into Matic\u2019s hands.
If you don\u2019t foul him, what can you do? If he gets a yard on you, you\u2019re not getting it back.
Granted, but the amount of spikes and hip checks he\u2019s taking are ridiculous.
It was ridiculous the amount of fouls on the poor kid the dreadful ref just let go. Stupid horrible ref.
agreed, could've been multiple called
Thanks tor speaking up and knowing what this club is!
Thanks and same to you, too many fans seem to miss the point glad there are enough fans who see the big picture too.
Lol!!!! Sad
Beating the poor teams is what we struggle at though ...
Are you ever happy
Gtfo plastic boy
Beat the top teams and its it doesn't matter unless we beat the lower teams, beat the lower teams and it's yeah but theyre shit lol...
> James is the better option against a Top 6 club\n\nHe was talking about Arsenal
crazy how we were 14th at one point and now were 7 points clear of them lol
Loved it. Pace of pass was good
Totally understand. Are the ones with players on them match day specific though? I legitimately don\u2019t know. I think they\u2019re awesome though. I\u2019m calling those  match-day scarves because I don\u2019t see them available on the United store ever. I\u2019d love to have one with Rashford, Martial, or De Gea on it.
They aren\u2019t match day specific. There is match day specific ones but the ones you\u2019re mentioning aren\u2019t.
They\u2019re not going to be on the store because they\u2019re sold by locals. No idea why I\u2019m getting downvoted and couldn\u2019t give a fuck but I\u2019m not wrong.\n\nI think it\u2019s odd that you\u2019d want a memento of a game you didn\u2019t go to, but hey, you do you.
I live in Singapore, trust me if I could attend every single MUFC game, I would. That makes me less of a fan? Would you stay up till 4 in the morning JUST to watch United? Even now?
Real class, so because you get to live near OUR team and attend the games frequently, you're better than a fellow dedicated fan from the other side of the world. Fuck you 3000!\nI live in the states and would give my left ball to be at Old Trafford for one game. ANY GAME.
[removed]
[removed]
It's about damn time.
cheers
nice to see someone answer honestly lol.
Lol
It\u2019s a meme from a few seasons ago
it was tight because of his first touch
Yeah he should have whacked it with his left.
He\u2019s still not close to good enough in pretty much any game.
Just lol at the excuses you guys keep making for him.
No, it has to be from my own pocket. Sacrifices must be made.
Agreed! Rashford been our best player this season
Thanks, could never understand it
He is not.
Not against Shaw completely but he\u2019s only gotten worse when it comes to his attacking contribution. Him against Newcastle on Boxing Day vs Williams today were night and day
Arsenal win would be good too, I just don\u2019t have faith of them being able to do anything, they\u2019re awful. Meh no one is going to catch Liverpool, Leicester choked when they needed to show something.
I\u2019ve accepted Pool winning the league, still don\u2019t want them to end undefeated or with a record tally or anything.
Look we all hate Pool, but we need to be realistic, better to have the teams around us dropping points to solidify at least a 5th place showing for the time being. Don\u2019t let your hate blind you, United first.
GGMU
Oops Sean gets it from the worms that he eats daily.
Isn\u2019t that how CR7 got his crazy goal record?
Just twerking for Jose for when transfer window opens
Cheeky swap for Son, worth it worth it.
He was still replaced by someone
Ole out group are on sucide watch
well ackshually I don't get invited to parties. so there. Also, it was a joke playing on our record of winning vs top 6, not picking up as many points against teams below us... Maybe you didn't hear me properly?
> *ackshually*
Fuck
Literally shaking rn
You\u2019re ignoring his contributions out of possession and his dead ball ability.
I've been one of his biggest critics but there has been a serious up turn in his displays recently. Not saying he is starting or even squad quality for the long run but he has certainly upped his game.
I think my criticism of mctominay is pretty fair. I've always said that he has a good defensive workrate which is useful against teams who dominate us but when it's time to play against teams who hand us possession hes one of the reasons we struggle to break down teams. His passing is genuinely shocking and I'm not sure I've seen a United midfielder as bad as him with the ball at his feet. I always compare mctominay to fred because I want people to realise what proper united quality midfielder looks like.
Nah, like your comments on him purely reek of personal vendetta due to internet arguments
I want what is best for the club and Ole leaving is what is best for the club. I'd rather we win and Ole be successful but we will never win a league title with him in charge.
> I want what is best for the club and Ole leaving is what is best for the  club. I'd rather we win and Ole be successful but we will never win a  league title with him in charge. \n\nu/mrpiggywinkles52, So you are admitting you want us to lose just so Ole gets the sacked?\n\nPlastic.
What\u2019s the benchmark for \u201cquality rotation player\u201d?  No goals or assists in a year is abysmal
Quality rotation player is an energetic veteran with skill like Lingard.
No, but you didn't make that distinction when you generally said 'A year with no no assists, goals...'
His pressing and false runs create trouble for opponents who plays with a high defensive line, making it more likely that we can hit them on the break. How is that not useful?
> His pressing and false runs\n\nThus just a more subtle way of saying work rate. It\u2019s literally the bare minimum for this system. This is what we expect from any player. In things that matter such as passing and finishing, he falls woefully short. He has good energy but his true place in the squad at a top team is 3rd or 4th choice. I doubt any club above 15th place would even take him as a starter
You're the only one mate
No one else in the supporters pub felt he did anything either. Love being down voted as if I talked shit about him.
Fair enough
What was he supposed to do? Run into his leg and get injured. As long as he wasn't rolling around like Neymar or shouting at the ref, he didn't deserve the yellow.
Yeah no doubt there are users who are really well reasoned and I love to read their opinions, one way or the other. But there are other regulars as well who are unreasonable to a point that no rebuttal can change their minds.
>I see no reason to have blind faith\n\nDid you miss the three summer transfers? \n\nI think the issue is with your outlook and the weird selective view that has given you.\n\n>blind faith\n\nwell you are half way with those blinkers on
No I didn't miss it, since I noticed that they got rid of two high profile players without trying to either upgrade or replace them.\n\nIt's great that United finally bought a first choice right back, and Maguire was a good buy. But it has not translated in to points yet, and apparently pointing that out makes me a shit fan.\n\nBut having followed United for 20 years, I should suddenly start being happy with anything.\n\nIf the consensus is that the eternal process that keeps United consistently at sub 70 points is fine, then I guess my standards are too high.
The future is now
\ud83e\udd2b
Sounds tough, she played centre half for Burnley?
#CSKA MOSKVA\n\nFite me.
Ha ha. Yeah. I think shooting practice needs to be next on the agenda.... amazing he is allowed to take some direct freekicks too!
Not Haaland anymore hahaha
Did he actually sign with Juventus then or is he staying?
He will get his chance I'm sure, young won't be in the way of that.\n\nYoung has proved time and time again that there is a space for him in this club.
I\u2019m not saying for a minute I\u2019m not grateful for everything he\u2019s done for United but in my opinion it\u2019s best to just let him go. \n\nWe\u2019ve been too sentimental to certain players and we need to be more ruthless to let Wan Bissaka, Laird, Dalot, Shaw and Williams take over.
I guess you haven't watched this team enough this season. McT is much better at both breaking attacks on the halfway line and keeping the ball. It's Fred's job to play the through balls.\nMatic will get the ball and take too long before passing so he doesn't give the ball away but slows down the attacks.
I've watched 90% of our games this season.\n\n>McT is much better at both breaking attacks on the halfway line and keeping the ball. I\n\nMctominay is probably better at breaking up attacks but he definitely isnt better at keeping the ball. Just look at their overall pass accuracy this season. Matic's passing accuracy is higher.\n\n\n>Matic will get the ball and take too long before passing so he doesn't give the ball away but slows down the attacks.\n\n Idk man matic moved the ball pretty well today and has been moving it well ever since he came back from injury.
This is the time of year which separates the men from the boys.\n\nIf we can keep getting points now we'll be in the race for top 4. That's good enough for me for now.
Arsenal always start well and tail off by the end. Remember they were top of the league at Christmas a few seasons and finished 4th eventually.
Don\u2019t the match-day ones have both teams/date on it?
Yep
Me either, I appreciate the feedback! But like I said, I want one with one of the players on it, which sounds like they aren\u2019t match-day specific. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d want one with both teams on it. \n\nI was calling them match-day scarves because I figured the ones with the players were only sold on match day if I am understanding correctly.\n\nEdit: in other words, I should say scarves that are sold on match-day.  My bad
Nah that\u2019s cool man I totally get it. Like I said originally I\u2019m not trying to be a dick at all.\n\nDm me I\u2019ll try to sort something out for you
Of course, but we play them once more still and nothing would be sweeter than to beat them and end any talk of an invincibles season.
In about 2 years mctominay he will struggle to make our bench and i want you to remember what u/cmonunited said about him \"hes bang average \". He would struggle to get a game for Brighton ffs.
As I said you clearly have an agenda against him, I will take my judgements from those who aren't invested.
I literally said I'd rather we win and I'd rather Ole be successful but that simply isn't going to happen and I'd rather we didn't all bury our heads in the sand and pretend everything is fine. Doing that is exactly how we got here. \n\nOle should've been sacked at the end of last season. He wasn't. As a result this season is virtually wasted. By burying our heads in the sand and pretending what we've seen this season is acceptable when Jose was sacked with LESS points is just ridiculous. We're only close to top 4 because Arsenal shit the bed, Lampard is inexperienced and Mourinho was taking over a shitshow of a spurs side and is a shell of his former self. You really think Ole would be competing with actual elite managers if those clubs had them in charge? We cannot and should not accept what we've gotten this season, if we do then we become more and more like the early 2010s Liverpool. Solskjaer is clearly not good enough and if we pretend like everything is OK and accept anything less than a top 4 finish without sacking him we'll waste next season too.\n\nI'd love him to be a success but he hasn't shown me anything to make me think he will be, Tactically he isn't on the level of even someone like Rodgers. His subs are often poor albeit he has limited materials to work with, he has no idea how to break down a bus, he relies far too much on counter attacking, our defence is bang average despite being a lot better on paper and there is no coherent structure, no plan to break down a defence and no patterns of play worth shit. I can't tell you what our style of  play even is beyond counters?\n\nHe's done some great things. Clearing out the deadwood, 3 good signings, improving Rashford, Scott, Martial, Fred etc. But he will not take us forwards. I hope he is successful but I know he won't be and him leaving is best for everyone. I go into every game wanting us to win but I accept that the manager isn't good enough and should've been sacked by now. The problem with people that are ardent Solskjaer defenders seems to be that many of them assume that wanting a new manager means wanting the club to fail and that you are a plastic, which is a bullshit elitist mentality when I literally said the opposite.
We won against Pep and Mourinho. We started figuring out low block teams, but yet Ole is still not enough for you mouth watering ole out plastics.\n\nAlso, I notice all the Ole out people constantly saying they can't see the tactics we are doing. maybe cause you are just a football fan with FM2019/Fifa 2019 knowledge? This people earned their coaching badges, I am sure they know more tactics then the armchair experts
Shouldn\u2019t be a starter for us neither, I don\u2019t think anyone is claiming that.
I agree. But for the level we aspire to be at, he shouldn\u2019t even be on the bench. Look at the squads of City, Liverpool, Leicester and Chelsea and see if he would even make the bench at those clubs. It\u2019s only because he\u2019s a local lad that he\u2019s survived so long. I don\u2019t hate the guy. I know he cares about the club and tries hard, but when an 18 year old with zero top flight experience before this season has scored more winners than he has, then it definitely is a sign that he needs to leave. Next summer, we should be looking to move on Jones, Rojo, Lingard, and Matic in that order
> are we sure he actually played? Near invisible.
Yes, that's exactly the same as complaining about a poor performance. Cheers for pointing that out. Expert analysis there.
>No I didn't miss it, since I noticed that they got rid of two high profile players without trying to either upgrade or replace them.\n\nlol like replacing Sanchez.  There is a process to go through and some crap to clean up.  3 starting signings is great.  Really absurd that you want Ole out and part of your justification is the summer signings.\n\n>apparently pointing that out makes me a shit fan\n\n>I noticed that they got rid of two high profile players without trying to either upgrade or replace them.\n\nNa it is your your logic and entitlement that is being questioned.  Your blind faith statement is absurdly irrational.\n\n>But having followed United for 20 years, I should suddenly start being happy with anything\n\nAbout 45 years here.  You seem to have an entitlement from watching us from and through the glory years.  I wasn't even part of the SAF (no S then) out brigade.\n\n>If the consensus is that the eternal process that keeps United consistently at sub 70 points is fine, then I guess my standards are too high.\n\nThere is hope that something new can be built now.  Weird you want to cut it off early.\n\nI totally get that how this should have played out is Ole not getting the early contract and then we would have Poch as manager now.  But that isn't what happened and Ole has shown he can sign starting players and deal with the predecessors issues (like loaning out the worst signing in EPL history).
If you said Zenit St. Petersburg my doubts of your MeMaw being Andrey Arshavin would have vanished.
Dortmund
DMed
So? Anyone can beat anyone, its the premier league. I don't see how we've started figuring out low block teams when we just lost to Watford, Burnley and Newcastle also absolutely gifted goals to us and we didn't create hardly any chances against Burnley really.\n\nI'm not a fortune teller, but the guy isn't a miracle worker, the signs aren't there. Call me a plastic all you want but sadly I'll be proven write.
Ole lose: ALL HIS FAULT\n\nOle wins: OPPONENT GAVE US THE WIN\n\nsums up you lot. Gtfo troll
The fact it\u2019s \u201cyou lot\u201d shows the Glazers are winning. We\u2019re all fans, we all want what\u2019s best for the club. We just differ on how to do it.  \n\nIt\u2019s not only oles fault. It\u2019s the boards and players too but only one of those things can be changed immediately
Nah, don't try and do that \"if you support Ole means you support  the glazers\" shit on me.\n\nWe are winning and you still only focus on the negative. Just gtfo. blocked.
I\u2019m not saying you support the Glazers. But they\u2019re trying To lower expectations and they are succeeding. \n\nI\u2019m not focusing on the negative. I\u2019m staying realistic and grounded. There is no point in burying our head in the sand.
Hotel  \u2705\nTrivago \u2705

Here we go! \u2705
Haaland \u2705
Fuck
Dirty players, thank god Mike Dean wasn't having none of it.
Fuck Biggie
Add Jon moss, the fat cunt to the list as well.
Where is jon moss?
Getting fucked.
TBF I thought Mike Dean was poor for both sides today. As always.
Probably won't sadly
Couldn't agree more. It's turning into a Hazard situation.
Has to
Yeah, it\u2019s getting absurd. At some point the whole \u201cthey didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d get to the ball!\u201d excise doesn\u2019t cut it.
When you say refs aren\u2019t protecting him do you mean as in they aren\u2019t giving yellows out quick enough for fouls on him? Cheers
Yes. If fouls go unpunished, the ref\u2019s simply enabling another free tactical foul later on that will then take a (later than deserved) yellow, which really isn\u2019t a significant punishment to a defensive team like Burnley that want to break up play and make it a fight.
Yeah at some point you have to put it out there
Lmao
Yeah really not sure why Williams didn't go LM and Shaw LB at the end there
its not like shaw is that much better at defending either, as the watford game showed
Shaw is so fucking fat, motherfucker never moves. So glad Williams played today and showed what the standard for work rate should be for a modern FullBack.
Post a pic of yourself then mate, and a video of you doing 50m sprints
I mean the yellow today was horeshit
He's had a couple needless ones in other games. I love it cause he clearly cares but long term needs to change
Agreed. The commentators said it's his 4th though so he's had 3 more in 4 games.
Can't start every game when you get a yellow in all of them.
Our academy players have been amazing this season, stepping up despite the pressure.
I still prefer Shaw. This was Williams\u2019 best game for us though.
Sadly looks like that's becoming a bit of a habit for him
He's too quick.
Dude runs so fast. Defenders don't have enough time to get out of his way
Pereira was pretty decent. Composed and transitioned the ball well for the most part.
What an assist for the first goal, great press, great composure
Hell, I thought he was great today
Created the first goal on his own
Yeah but pereira sucks. He just isn\u2019t good enough. He never looks up while the ball is at his feet, which means either he gets a lucky assist or the attack fizzles out due to a loss of possession.
Pereira has been playing well in his last few games.
He's been playing better but he makes bonehead mistakes still.
He's playing better but still not enough. Needs to keep improving. Might be another year or 2 until he has a real shout at being someone that can change the game.
Didn't he join in January?
That\u2019s why I thought you meant he had a bad half season. Jan-May.
