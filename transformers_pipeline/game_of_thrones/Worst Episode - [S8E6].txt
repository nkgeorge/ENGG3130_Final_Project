Thanks again to everyone who has taken part in these surveys over the past three seasons! If anyone ever wants to run their own for a show they love, I'd be happy to answer any questions that might help. And, as I mentioned in the post-ep thread, I'll be doing these for r/netflixwitcher next.\n\nKeep an eye out for our post-season survey too (and a post-series one). The goal for the former is this Sunday.\n\n||E1|E2|E3|E4|E5|E6|E7|E8|E9|E10|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**S6**|[**7.1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4gwva4/s6e1_postepisode_survey_results_s6e1_the_red_woman/)|[**8.8**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4i2x8m/s6e2_postepisode_survey_results_s6e2_home/)|[**8.0**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4j5gnk/s6e3_postepisode_survey_results_s6e3_oathbreaker/)|[**8.4**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4k5rp2/s6e4_postepisode_survey_results_s6e4_book_of_the/)|[**8.9**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4l8s6e/s6e5_postepisode_survey_results_s6e5_the_door/)|[**7.3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4ma5xn/s6e6_postepisode_survey_results_s6e6_blood_of_my/)|[**8.0**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4ne0fw/s6e7_postepisode_survey_results_s6e7_the_broken/)|[**6.6**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4ogr0k/s6e8_postepisode_survey_results_s6e8_no_one/)|[**9.5**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4pjwaw/s6e9_postepisode_survey_results_s6e9_battle_of/)|[**9.6**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4qoqna/s6e10_postepisode_survey_results_s6e10_the_winds/)|\n|**S7**|[**7.7**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6ogfac/s7e1_postepisode_survey_results_s7e1_dragonstone/)|[**7.9**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6pzoyn/s7e2_postepisode_survey_results_s7e2_stormborn/)|[**8.2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6rfwxw/s7e3_postepisode_survey_results_s7e3_the_queens/)|[**9.3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6ssvwj/s7e4_postepisode_survey_results_s7e4_the_spoils/)|[**8.3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6uc47a/s7e5_postepisode_survey_results_s7e5_eastwatch/)|[**8.3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6vtn7z/s7e6_postepisode_survey_results_s7e6_beyond_the/)|[**8.9**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6x7881/s7e7_postepisode_survey_results_s7e7_the_dragon/)|/|/|/|\n|**S8**|[**7.5**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/beokob/spoilers_postepisode_survey_results_s8e1/)|[**7.9**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bhc4jv/spoilers_postepisode_survey_results_s8e2_a_knight)|[**7.9**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bjwi71/spoilers_postepisode_survey_results_s8e3_the_long/)|[**6.2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bmj8ne/spoilers_postepisode_survey_results_s8e4_the_last/)|[**6.3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bpc20p/spoilers_postepisode_survey_results_s8e5_the/)|5.5|/|/|/|/|\n\n(click on the score to view full results)
Seeing the scores decrease and fall off so sharply from the end of season 7 to the finale is a sight to behold. Really sums up the half-assed way they finished off the series.
Keep in mind, the online backlash started with the Dorne storyline and how Stannis was written in season 5.\n\nThen season 7 had it's own set of problems with concerns like instant teleportation that was dismissed as \"nitpicking\". Took awhile but it finally bubbled up
The IMDB scores are pretty rough too. The 6 episodes from Season 8 are in the lowest 6 spots in the overall episode ranking.
It may not be the worst episode but it\u2019s significance in the story will always cause people to treat it more harshly. This is literally the episode that brings everything to a close, everything you have been hoping for over the past 8 years. \n\nBran becoming king was so left field and a nonsensical decision. It wasn\u2019t early and make the whole story feel empty.
I disagree, I think this really was the worst episode ever. It was a really terrible episode, the only ones that give it a run for its money were in this season.\n\nSeasons 1-4 were great, Seasons 5-6 were a drop-off in quality but we're talking a dropoff from a fantastic show to just a pretty good show. Season 7 was where it started to becoming really mediocre, but mediocre still isn't *awful.* And there aren't any episodes from seasons pre-S7 that specifically stand out to me as being bad on their own.
You liked the sand snakes confirmed
I agree, the journey beyond the wall is the stupidest and worst episode(s) in the entire show (and whichever the episode in which that Dorne girl said \"You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy\", fuck that episode.)\n\nFuck that episode was filled with teleportation, plot armor, plot convenience, and it was just a dumb mission from the beginning.\n\nLiterally all it did was to give the NK a dragon so that he could destroy the wall, that was the writers' purpose of that journey.
That \"Why do you think I came all this way?\" line *really* pissed people off.
Yes. For someone who doesn't \"want\", he showed particular arrogance about taking the throne. I would say he wanted it very much.
He picks when he wants to be a Stark and when he wants to be the raven at the plot\u2019s convenience.
As it should have. You can\u2019t just put in a sinister line like that, accompany it with upbeat triumphant music *and then never mention it again!*!  \n\nWe still know fuck all about Bran. When has wanting power or wanting the throne ever been a part of his character? When has he ever been shown to be a master manipulator of anything? (And no the dagger doesn\u2019t count, you can make that argument but it was never explicitly stated he had any other reason for giving it to Arya other than because he\u2019s a cripple). What was the point of his warging? What was the point of his time altering abilities? What was the point of him learning Jon\u2019s heritage? Aside from very very brief visions of what appears to be the sept explosion and Drogon flying over KL *nothing* else implied he knew the future and was manipulating events?  \n\nYou took a crippled boy with inexplicable powers, gave him an incredible journey which included arguably the shows most powerful scene (Hold the door), and then turned him into a pointless emotionless robot who\u2019s abilities or motivations are never explained in the slightest, and the sum of his contributions to the plot are being used as bait so the entire overarching plot of the show can be shanked out of existence by a teleporting teenage girl, and then being elected king for even more mind boggling reasons.  \n\nI mean pretty much none of the main characters had satisfying arcs in the end, but Bran was definitely the worst
Its so 2000's action movie ending line.
The 60 seconds later says to Tyrion that he doesnt want to be king.\n\nGet the fuck out of here you stupid prick. If you didnt want it why come all this way?..... and then no fucker pulls him up on that!!!!\n\n Fuck me the script was bad.
Bran is the true villain at the end of this series who got the Iron Throne by doing practically nothing and letting hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians die, it's infuriating
Yeah especially since this Lad had no I mentions of being king or a Lord
I dont fucking know. Cus your sisters rolled your ass all the way here while you stared blankly at people.
And then when he appoints Tyrion as hand and Tyrion says he doesn\u2019t want it, bran says \u201cand I don\u2019t want to be king\u201d. ??????????
well blame the show writers for not showing us when he revealed information to different people throughout the show. my favorite example was the ending of Littlefinger, based on everything we were shown up to the point we were led to believe LF was going to get his way, please tell me Arya didn't check with Bran to learn the truth. She recognized just what he could do the day they met under the tree.\n  \nIt simply can be put to down to he told who needed to know and only them but its not beneficial to the audience to know what is going to happen so we cannot be shown interactions with Bran for that reason. \n  \nthat last line is probably just par for the course with regards to writing quality
I liked it lol
Hes worse than Frodo at this point
> That \"Why do you think I came all this way?\" line really pissed people off.\n\nThat's something I dont get; I personally saw it as more of a \"I knew I had to become the king and so thats why I'm here\" not as a power craving \"yes I came because I wanted to be king\" kind of line. Maybe I'm the one that's wrong though but to me it makes a lot more sense, especially with the \"upbeat triumphant\" music.\n\nI've also assumed from the start that the 3ER is not evil and just does what he's supposed to do, with no hidden motives, so maybe that's also why I assumed it was a positive line.
Worst Line and scene of the whole show.
Well I mean, it speaks for itself
It was an insanely stupid line, considering like two episodes ago he said he couldn\u2019t be lord of anything. The writers must really think the audience was dumb.
when I read the leaks, I was shocked, he was the last on my list to get the Iron Throne. I thought it'd be Gendry because he got legitimized, and surely there must be an actual reason for that other then Daenerys gaining more loyal soldiers. But then I thought, there hasn't really been any build-up whatsoever indicating Gendry with leadership skills so he can't be the king. Neither can Tyrion, it'd be hella awkward if that happened. But for Bran to be the chosen one, never in a million years would I thought him as a candidate lmao.
Tyrion being left out of the story was the worst of the worst for me. Literally makes no sense.
The thing is, he had the potential to be the most interesting. Instead of wasting so much time with his story we could have spent it getting to know him and his powers. Is the 3ER good? Does he still feel? What does he want? How do his powers work? Why does he act the way he does? Doing so could have made the White Walkers more interesting too.\n\nThe problem is he ended up being a dull and poorly explained character. Him taking the throne could have been interesting, but it just ended up seeming stupid. I wonder if the showrunners only found out he was king later on and mistakenly downplayed his arc.
I just don\u2019t understand why the OG 3ER had so much more emotional scale than Bran did once he became the 3ER. Fucking robot.
I agree. Although even if they found out later about Bran being king they honestly could have cut out the Brienne/Jamie, Arya/Gendry, Bronn/Tyrion scenes and given us a couple 3ER scenes, or just added a few more minutes. Not that I have an issue with any of these scenes, I just don't understand why they'd add these subplots that are relatively unimportant to the story when, clearly, there was something extremely important about the 3ER. There's actually a lot more about the 3ER in the books so it's not like they didn't have extra material to work with.

Who was the first King of Seven (sorry Six) Kingdoms to be selected by popular vote.   Damn this script.  Damn it all to hell.
What did you expect? He did literally nothing significant entire series and then he's being crowned as king lmao.
He never did anything and for whatever reason he got the throne... Hell, Three Eyed Raven and didn't do anything special except being stoned and flying around with a raven and killing Hodor...
No, he's just the least people's favourite. For all you know he could be everyone's 2nd best.
Really. Bran.
Fewest*
:|
He absolutely 100% was the least popular before the final episode, aside from Rickon who was just a footnote. I don't know anybody who was particularly interested in or cared about Bran at all. On top of that, we don't know dick about his powers, really, and they were never particularly useful in any way, despite the show spending plenty of time on him.\n\nI think the last episode pissed people off enough that they voted Rickon over him just out of spite.
He's the new Joffrey.
[https://twitter.com/vornietom/status/1130522571210838016?s=20](https://twitter.com/vornietom/status/1130522571210838016?s=20)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis person gave a wicked Bran theory that makes him a lot more exciting.
Everyone's seen that theory, and it was made a before that person rambled on it. Was on ASOIAF after Episode 3.
He was an odd choice... no leadership experience and no charisma
Because his character serves zero purpose to the show than to utter dumb bullshit and state off into the distance.
Well that's because they turned him into a creepy, almost inanimate part of the set for the past two seasons. What made GoT great was its dynamic characters and complicated plot, which he was not only left out of most of the end of the series, but also apart from for most of the middle. His story was always tangential, then non-existent, then they made him king. What?!
How dare you say that about our king!
Forget Rickon, even Dickon is more popular than Bran
Rickard.
Ser Pounce is more popular than Bran
Everyone likes a good Dickon :)
It's still called seven kingdoms. I think.
They said Lord of the Six Kingdoms multiple times
Dude you spelled vagetreble wrong
Vegeterrible*
Vegemite
They didn't bother to even try and bring Catelyn back either as the one ghost character
Unpopular opinion. But I think Bran is great. Even better in the books.
Protest vote? I can only read it as someone saying \u201cI don\u2019t like any Stark in the show\u201d
This is an insult to my boy Ned, who died long before his character could be ruined.
Nailed it. The other Starks turned into caricatures of themselves.
1. Most people weren't terribly interested in Bran before he went all 3ER\n\n2. When he went 3ER, he lost literally all of his personality and he became one of the least interesting characters to watch on the show.\n\n3. Bran getting his powers ate up a lot of screen time and was, in the end, almost entirely pointless - which was already making people like him less and less as the series closed out, but then the \"Bran is king now because why not\" twist at the end pissed off enough people that they probably voted Rickon just out of spite.\n\nRegarding Catelyn: I think it's just that most people would vote other Starks (who are still alive) over her, and there are also probably fans who started watching later on and may have missed her entirely. Ned, conversely, was a fan-favorite character in the short term he was around, got a LOT of screen time then, and he's also probably the vote for people who want to express \"I preferred the old show.\"
Just wait until Grrm finishes Winds. Rickon will bring Unicorns to Westeros and fucks Ramsay's army.
Shaggy dog was pretty bad ass so it's a package vote I suppose
The same way ghost is so loved. Characters that D&D just forgot about for seasons at a time
I think because everyone hates Bran *that* much they probably chose Rickon out of spite, which I can\u2019t say I blame them .
> While I'm not exactly surprised that Bran is the least favorite, how the hell did Rickon get so many votes? He was the most useless Stark of them all.\n\nI liked Rickon in the books and show. \n\n A lot of the child characters got aged up significantly for their roles in the show and go on to do a lot within the story and travel the kingdoms, meeting different people (as high lords would). \n\n Rickon is just a child who has (hasn't?) grown up as he witnessed his father leave, all of his brothers leave (Not sure how he viewed Jon) and got stuck in Winterfell with his crippled older brother and Theon. \n\n He was the innocent character who just wanted a normal life and couldn't really comprehend everything that was happening and just wanted to be with his older brother (Bran) and to grow up.
> Catelyn should have beaten him at least \n\n&#x200B;\n\n My brain glitched and took this as: If Catelyn had beaten up her son, he would've been less useless.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(Whelp, guess who's getting sterilized. /s)
I was pretty disappointed that her ability to steal faces never came into play again. Just like a lot of things it leaves you wondering \u201cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201d
Poor writing; and two folks who probably wanting to go play Star Wars. How'd they take how many years between seasons to fuck not only the cast and show over, but the writing and fans. HBO should never be given the reigns of something lile this. HBO; we know how to write 4 good seasons of a series; then we just don't know\"
Hey, she is badass.  That is how she recognized that a genocidal lunatic was a killer.
\"I know a killer when I see one\"\n\nPeople who torch entire cities tend to be killers yes....\n\nGreat observation
\"Woah now Arya, I'm just supposed to take your word for that?  I'm going to need at *least* a 20 page paper with citations.\"
after being ok with her brother bending the knee to the very same person.
People eat that shit like burrito.
But people eat that shit up.  That's the exact kind of lame that spawns Twitter worship.
I agree. The \"I might die, I like a boy, boink boink boink, all night long\" facade was pretty tiring too.
What? She was scared or crying on screen for half the season?\n\nPlus, the question asked who was your favorite Stark overall not your favorite Stark in a poorly written season.\n\nIt's not surprising when you consider: \n\n1. Tywin/Arya scenes are some of the best in the entire series \n\n2. Arya/The Hound is the best pairing in the show and their scenes are also amongst the best\n\n3. Maisie gave the best performance of all of the Stark kids in the better seasons and was the only one amongst them to get an Emmy nomination. \n\n4. I don't think Arya has a single boring moment in her arc from season 1 through her arrival in Braavos(Harrenhall, list of names, Yoren, The Brotherhood, The Hound, Tywin; etc. is brilliant). \n\n5. The Frey Massacre  is an excellent fan service moment \n\nI didn't like the way she was written in season 7 and season 8 was only slightly better but she'll always be my favorite Stark on the strength of seasons 1-4 alone.
What? She was still fucking great. Especially when she killed the Night King. She saved the fucking world.
Yeah Cat is the most underrated character, maybe in anything. The most well acted, super complex with a mix of flaws and great/badass/emotional traits, just an all around fantastic character.
Yeah, if you take Cat out of the show, the whole thing kind of falls apart
You have to admit, she was kind of a bitch...
Yeah and dany was insane, Jon was stupid, Geoffrey cruel, Tommen weak, Tywin ruthless.  Each characters qualities whether they be likable or not contributed to this amazing story. So I admire them all the same, what\u2019s there to admire about rickon? Kid came up with the by far worst name for his wolf and didn\u2019t know how to zig zag he made absolutely no contribution to the story.
As a person or a character ? I didn\u2019t love her but I as a lot of respect for her.
I agree - the wight hunt was completely pointless in retrospect. Cersei didn't send any of her forces, and they easily won even without her help. Thoros and Benjen died for absolutely nothing.
It was pretty pointless at the time, not just retrospect. What about Cersei made it seems like she would be convinced? It was pretty clear that the writers knew they wanted the NK to have a dragon and had to reverse engineer a plot to make that happen. And thus Dumb Plan (TM) was born.
It would have made a hell of a lot more sense if they planned on leading the wight through the streets of King\u2019s Landing, helping Dany to look like the protector of the people. \n\nCersei could then send her army north, but only so far as the Neck to stop the Northern Coalition from coming south. History repeats itself but in reverse when it becomes clear that the Neck can\u2019t hold against dragons - Cersei and the Lannister army retreat to King\u2019s Landing and the Golden Company gets wiped out at the Neck. \n\nThen they don\u2019t have to change too much from the general trajectory of the plot other than covering up stupid mistakes (like Dany forgetting about the Iron Fleet). It would have made a neat dichotomy between Dany coming to King\u2019s Landing as the protector of life and then coming to the city as the harbinger of death. \n\nAgain, I think that a lot of problems this season come down to the fact that too much was crammed in in too few episodes and seasons. Let Dany\u2019s desire to be feared rather than loved take up more than 30 minutes of screen time. Make Tyrion\u2019s desperate desire to be loved and accepted by his sister, and guilt over killing Tywin, serve as his justification for trusting Cersei so much. Just give the audience and the characters time to breath and act like real people.
Easily won? Only if you know you have plot armor. Hopefully the characters aren't aware of the existence of D&D
I get we needed more time for the turn of Dany; but damn. They wasted 1 full episodes on pointless grobble in episode 1. The army of the dead can move stupid fast in battle. Yet they march super slow?
That episode sucked after the ending lol.
> completely pointless\n\n\nI agree, but an argument can be made that the wight hunt convinced Dany that the NK & AotD needed to be defeated.
It's called bad writing. I will never recommend this show to anyone because every storyline gets thrown out the window for big budget and looks in S8. Entire show ruined in 6 episodes they should at least get an award for that.
I mean, just because it didn't work doesn't mean it was the wrong decision. They needed ALL the help they can get. This was their only hope of getting her to fight with them. It didn't work. Sometimes you gotta take risks.
It convinced Jamie to go north.  His presence clearly motivated Brienne.   \n\nWithout Jamie,   Winter fell is overrun quicker, and The Night King kills Bran before Arya can Air Jordan.
Realistically they should have just asked Cersei for a truce so that everyone could complete final preparations for winter. Both sides have been devestated by war,  the wagon train raid showed that King's landing was at real risk of being starved out. EDIT not saying that would have worked either, but it would have been a lot easier than some crazy raid to capture a white.
Don\u2019t forget Viscerion
Man, if Emilia Clarke was my aunt, you wouldn't even have to ask me twice.
So, it is all about cocks in the end as Jaime admits in S7E1
Dumbest story of the series..still ridiculous how that episode got good ratings and reviews
It was much more ridiculous than anything this season
 \"not taking one for the team and fucking his aunt\" lmfao
It depends. Do we judge a decision by the information available to the characters at the time, or with full hindsight? Some good decisions turn out horribly...
Not only was it a bad decision in the show, it was also a terrible decision by the writers. S07E05 is precisely the episode where the whole show goes to shit and never recovers.
Even someone with half a brain would have realized that Cersei has no reason to help, even if the WW are real. And when you think that the one that came up with this plan was Tyrion, the one tormented by Cersei from his birth (according to Oberyn) and who was presented since the beginning as a very smart character that also knew what kind of person Cersei is, is even more mind-boggling.
Telling Jon who his parents are has to be up there.
And then the dead dragon was hyped up in the finale of season 7 and then it really did nothing after that.  What a damn let down so many of these plots were\n\nIt was such a stupid plan and stupid writing I thought the only logical thing (at first) was Tyrion was manipulating them somehow for the good of his own house.  Now I realize it\u2019s just shitty writing
You didn\u2019t even need hindsight to know it was the worst decision. The wights aren\u2019t smart. Set a trap, come back in the morning. Boom! Got yourself a scary dead guy! Or maybe send more than like 6 guys to get em.
Catelyn arresting Tyrion wins.
What a dumb bitch, that one. She did not deserve my man Ned.
So the conclusion was that the D makes the world spin? :P
Worst thing about that wight hunt is they could have easily just not burnt the next dead watchman or something. No need to have a whole big storyline about it.
Idk planning to put a huge proportion of the living army into an unarmed cavalry charge is mighty dumb. At least there was reasoning with Beyond the Wall.
All she wanted was the D and he didn\u2019t deliver. Moral of the story: Satisfy your woman and she won\u2019t go out and kill a million people.
Note: wight hunt only exists to extend the final season into two smaller seasons. \n\nFor an addendum to the close second, can we add not giving any dialogue to Jon for  exposition on his feelings (or lack thereof?) for Dany? Totally unclear to me whether he lover her or not... or maybe that's the intent? Dany: \"Jon loves me, Jon loves me not, Jon loves me, Jon loves me not...???\"
I dunno. Tywin not locking the toilet door behind him was a pretty bad mistake.
Plus Jon Snow himself goes on this daring, wacky mission. Yeah it puts a character in there everyone cares more about so there's dramatic tension, but that's pretty pointless to have him in the party logically.
This will happen  \ud83d\udc4d
You rock!
Maybe make a post where you take some suggestions for different questions / answers?
You\u2019re the best!
Also, one question should be \"Do you think S8 made the previous seasons less interesting for you?\"\n\nPlus, at \"Who was the most interesting villain?\" you should clearly add Bran :P
Top draw.
I can't wait.
Well he could just, you know, return to Winterfell. There's nothing really forcing him to go North after Greyworm leaves. Even his \"exile\" makes no sense.
Actually shouldn't he be able to? Sansa doesn't bend the knee to Bran so Winterfell can do whatever the hell they want.
Does he even want to return to Winterfell? He and Sansa never seemed particularly close in the show, and that was before she betrayed his trust.\n\nAlso, without White Walkers the North isn't quite as horrible a place to live. The final shots even suggested it was starting to thaw.\n\nBeing a wildling might not be so bad, all things considered.
Yeah he loved being a wildling in the early seasons
I was one of the people who said Jon the Just. I thought I was clever. Apparently not.
>ttyl\n\nExcept not because they\u2019ll be too busy ruining Star Wars.
That's already been done.
Probably that describes the notes GRRM gave them...
No shit, their job as writers was to fill in the gaps and create a compelling story that achieved the bullet points given by GRRM. They failed spectacularly.
It's clear the writers just wanted to be done with the show and move on to other projects. That's the only explanation I have for this cluster fuck.
that's not a scoop, it is known
I think it was more that he was weird and I never cared about his story and then some how he magically became the most important person in Westeros for the dumbest reason in the dumbest way. Plus the other Starks were more entertaining and had better stories/arcs
See I found Brans's story line to be the most mysterious & intriguing throughout the entire show, but yeah they ended it horribly.
Rickon?
bUt hE hAs ThE bEsT sToRy ThOuGh
Even before becoming the 3ER i feel his story line was always the least talked about, it just felt so disconnected from everything else and his characters was always kind of boring, the only likeable things in his arc were Hodor and Summer.
Don\u2019t forget about Jojen and my girl Meera. I liked them when they were around.
Bran's storyline was one of my favorites before the whole Hodor climax. It had a fun supporting cast in Osha, the Reeds and Hodor, and the mystery of what the White Walkers are and what his visions mean was interesting. It's just the conclusion that sucked.
I haven't known anybody who ever really gave a shit about Bran. He was more popular than Rickon, but only because Rickon barely existed. They spent so much time on Bran, he became the 3ER and lost literally all of his personality, and in the end him becoming the 3ER ultimately just felt kind of pointless anyway. Rickon beating him out was just a spite vote I think, but if you removed Rickon from the poll he would have been last no matter what at any point.
That wad the main problem of GoT - the storylines werent connected. This also led to the biggest disappointment with the almost meaningless battle for Winterfell and the death of the NK. \nAnd all they did to connect the two plots was making Bran the king?
Not to mention completely stupid and illogical.\n\n\"I'm not Brandon Stark anymore\"\n\n\"I'm the Three-Eyed Raven\"\n\n\"I'm no one\"\n\nThen in S8E6\n\n\"Bran the Broken!\"\n\nLike wtf.
[deleted]
>\"I'm no-one.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeason 5 No-Show Bran trained with Faceless Men confirmed.
> It just felt so forced\n\nYup. I don't ever recall seeing him transition from normal Bran in training to emotionless Bran. One seen he is normal, the next scene we see him he is emotionless. No transition, no clear or well illustrated reason, just forced.
Yeah, I think D&D went for unpredictability for the sake of unpredictability. No one predicted Bran because no one thought such an inane character would be picked as king. But D&D didn't realize unpredictability alone doesn't make a good story.
I think the intention was to make him like a puppet figure and have the real power be those who rule on the board, so nobody is actually truly with sole power. But even then, still weird.
I had to vote him because I thought back and realized how much I liked his character. I loved that he was filling the role his father left and marching to war to save his father
He got rated behind Sansa... WTF?\n\nPeople need to go back and rewatch seasons 1-4. Before the show's writing took a turn.\n\nRobb's story came to a tragic end yes, but his character, his flaws, and his greatest mistakes were all beautifully written.
I'd argue Robb suffers from being to similar to Ned. I chose Ned but Robb would've likely been #2(possibly Jon).
Amen.
There's not going to be any spinoffs based on this era of GoT.
I can easily see them doing a spinoff with older Arya, especially if the prequels go well. Casuals will love the idea and HBO will make bank.
No spinoffs for the main cast or anyone from this timeline.
Maybe there\u2019s like a weird limbo of nothing-ness if you die but are meant to be brought back to life? Definitely would have had some plot conflicts but plot didn\u2019t matter much in the 8th season anyway
Also, a lot of the storylines of the Starks were influenced by Ned and his teachings to his children. He let Arya start training, set Sansa up with her \"dream guy\", taught Jon and Robb about integrity and honor.
Agree. I feel like the true overall winner of the GOT is ned. You canclearly see his philosphy and actions ripple through the rest of the story ajd characters whilst tywins on the other hand led to the demise of most of his family other than tyrion who killed him.
Very true.
Were people counting the young Ned flashback scenes when they voted? They're brief but I didn't even think about that. I was only thinking of Sean Bean's portrayal.
Seen Been is that dude
He played Ted Snark
he is a lovely human Bean
I always thought him throttling LF was kind of a dick move, but overall he was cool. Earned my vote.\r\rHis speech when he's talking with Varys in the dungeon is one of my favorite scenes in the show.\r\r> You think my life is some precious thing to me? That I would trade my honor for a few more years of... Of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and learnt it well. I grew up with soldiers. I learned how to die a long time ago...\r\rChills. So good. Also kind of meta in that it's Sean Bean delivering it lol.
It\u2019s an interesting motivation for why he refused to let go of his honour. But what about his children? Was he fine that they would be left alone in Kings Landing with no one else to care for them? That was incredibly selfish what Ned did in hindsight.
When I saw that combination, I thought that would be the least likely to happen considering that Jon will not leave the north anytime soon and Arya will definitely stay as far away from the freezing cold as possible
It won't be freezing cold, grass was starting to grow, you could see a sprouting plant when Jons walking North
Everyone will meet everyone again except Arya who will never return imo.
I mean she will just end up in Essos. It's well established in the lore that the world of Asoiaf is round, and that if you go west of westeros you end up in Essos.
I thought the same about Arya (only that she would die because she didn't find land), however I was left with a feeling that none of the other would meet again at all. Though Sansa may travel north and surprise me and Jon or if she were to go to KL because of some obligatory event\n\nIt only felt like Jon and Arya were close-knit too me
I don't think people went by logic, but by the feel the series left them with. To be honest, a lot of stuff in this season (way too many) were illogical at best.
Indeed. I hate the excuse that \"This is a fantasy series with dragons and magic, it doesn't have to make perfect sense!\" Even in a fantasy setting, a story still needs to adhere to basic internal rules, such as the laws of physics, logic, common sense, and consistency with the story's *own established lore and character development.* \"Suspension of disbelief\" isn't limited to just imaginary creatures.\n\nAt the very least, seasons 7 and 8 needed to be full, 10-episode seasons to give the story room to breathe. Ideally, it should have gone on for 9 full seasons, and with D&D replaced as writers if they made it clear they weren't willing to put in the effort anymore.
there was too much fan service in this season and it really wrecked timing and how scenes played out by the end. Instead of missing pieces of the story we got fan service scenes and that did not benefit anyone
Maybe the North is what's west of Westeros.
It would be funny if Arya has every intention of seeing Jon again but didn't want Sansa or Bran to know she was planning on coming back to westeros to visit.
We've seen people teleporting all over the place, distance is not a hindrance in Westeros
They hatin' on my boy Tyrion by not giving him a redhead dreamy queen. They even hinted at getting their marriage back on track during the battle of Winterfell
Bran and Jon are the second most likely to meet besides Bran and Sansa, the others have like, zero chance IMO. Arya is gone for good, flat out. Even if she doesn't die a horrific death like she would in the books for trying to sail west, there's no way she'd ever come back or make the journey back. \n\nJon is going north and has zero reason to go back south, the only person he might ever interact with is Bran, if Bran retires and also returns to beyond the wall to live in a tree again. \n\nSansa will likely meet with Bran for diplomatic stuff and maybe visits, but she'd never go beyond the wall or out to see
I voted for Bran and Jon as one of the more likely ones in case they find out something else about the White Walkers and Children.
Yeah they did. They fought against the Greyjoys together. I believe Rob said it had been 9 years or something like that since they'd seen each other; Robert's rebellion ended 17 years prior.
To be fair though, that was back when Westeros was much larger, a trip from Winterfell to Kings Landing took quite a while. Westeros has gotten much smaller, it's like less than a day trip to get to Kings Landing apparently
Oh yeah! Still only once in 17ish years though, and Bran and Sansa wouldn't travel to fight in rebellions.
YOU'RE THE KING'S HAND! YOU'LL DO AS I COMMAND, OR I'LL FIND ME A HAND WHO WILL!
I think Sansa and Jon will have the best chance to happen considering that they're not that far away from each other
I get the feeling both really don't like each other. Sansa basically spent three seasons undermining Jon and ended up with his title at the end of it.
Politics and cooperation would bring them together though.
Bran is an evil, smug little shit with the voice of somebody from Hull.
I've been saying for 5 days now that while there are legitimate gripes with this season (the pacing), like 90% of the whinging is contrived circlejerk from people who just weren't paying enough attention to get through the (unfortunately) faster pacing.\n\nExhibit A.
This really is the correct answer because:\n\n* Arya and Jon are the 2 Starks that the majority of everyone cares about\n* The relationship between Arya and Jon is one of the most popular relationships on the series and even their reunion was the most anticipated reunion for Season 8 so people just like thinking of them together and hanging out
I'm one of those who voted for Jon+arya as most likely reunion and don't see my reasons listed in these comments so will explain myself.\n\nFirst let's get suspicions of positive bias out of the way: I don't really like any of the starks that ended up alive, found them all annoying for various reasons (i did like jon and arya at one point but grew sick of them in later seasons), so it's not about me being fans of those characters and being hyped about reunions. If you had to twist my arm and force me to name a fav stark of the survivors it would be Sansa who I used to despise but ended up neutral towards her because her cattiness made me lol and her evolution into a grown up mean girl made sense, only stark that wasn't ruined in my eyes. \n\nSo why did I say I believed Jon and Arya are most likely to meet up one day? Because they are the only ones who actually like each other enough to go through the trials necessary to find each other. For all the talk about the Starks being a pack, I honestly felt they didn't care much about each other at the end.\n\n\\-Bran Stark: isn't likely to travel from KL and view him as a hands off king who will spend his time warging and giving cryptic advice whilst letting the council do the heavy lifting, occasionally indulging in 4d chess moves. I don't see him becoming nostalgic for his family or even caring much for anything anymore so the odds of him visiting any of the others is remote. If he does want to see his family, he will just warg and spy on them and be done with it and i'd hardly call that a reunion especially when the other party doesn't even know he is there.\n\n\\-Sansa: doesn't actually like any of her surviving siblings, tolerates them at best. And she is queen of her own kingdom now so will be plenty busy managing her affairs and continuing the stark line (once she has kids she will have even less inclination to travel north to visit jon, who again, she doesnt care for that much to begin with, so they could be close together geographically speaking or on opposite sides of the world, it's not likely to happen). Any contact she will have with bran will be via intermediaries and ambassadors, it is unlikely Sansa will ever travel south again and Bran won't be going north either as explained above.\n\nJon: Is actually the most sociable of the surviving starks which kind of says it all...And the dude is so ned like that he won't break his oath and will stay in the north, so won't be visiting sansa even if he really wanted to.\n\nAnd being with the wildlings he might be hard to find, I just don't see queen sansa mucking around in the untamed north risking herself to find jon for a friendly chat.\n\nWhich leaves me to...\n\nArya: Yes she is last seen sailing away, but unless she dies at sea (and she is such a fan favorite i'd find that end a bit anti climactic, though perfectly in line with what GoT used to be) then chances are ONE day, even if its in 40 years time, Arya will come back to westeros even if its for a short nostalgia stay.\n\nAnd which of the starks would she go see? Jon of course, they are the only 2 to have a bond that might endure the test of time.\n\nAnd unlike Sansa, I can actually picture a seasoned Arya being able to trek across the north to find Jon wherever he might be. If she survived her boat ride, that should be ez pz.\n\nAnd that is why I voted Arya+Jon most likely reunion over sansa+jon (who are not even that \"close\" btw, the north is huge and jon isn't likely to have a fixed address that makes finding him easy) or sansa+bran (they have 0 desire to meet and neither would want to move from their respective kingdoms). That was my tldr of the day!
Very well said!

Confirmed, there were TWO that said that
Kings Landing was an inside job. Bran knew about it before it happened. Dragon fire cannot melt steel beams.
I like your thinking. This even fits with that useless white horse at the end of Episode 5.
Yea it was pretty stupid how the last scene of E5 is Arya leaving on the white horse, and then her first scene in E6, she's still in the city, but on foot, and the horse is never seen again. Wtf was the point?
[deleted]
\\>Only one thought in mind\n\nHey, he was also thinking about fucking the queen.
Maybe that was by the by. 88% of people agreed that he knew Kongs Landing (thanks to op who first wrote the typo) would burn. If he knew it, why not try to stop it? Maybe don\u2019t tell Jon about his parents?
Its sort of like Dr Strange, but evil.
/u/Grochen
[deleted]
Neither option is in any way established in the series.
Do you watch Marvel movies? I'm trying to be vague in case you don't. They are referencing that.
After reading someone else accidentally calling it Kongs Landing I can\u2019t help but refer to it that way now.
I think you\u2019ve hit the perfect episode.
I'm so glad people keep making this typo.
I'm telling you, if the show ended with a scene of Jon finding a WW spiral and a shot of just Bran the show would have a VERY different story
Yes! That\u2019s what I think! I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s what the writers intended, let\u2019s face it probably not, but it\u2019s right there in the script!
I dont think that says he's evil at all. He might either be 1. neutral and just goes with the literal flow (of time), and does what he SHOULD do based on what he's seen, or 2. he's a good guy and alternates the future for the best result. Yeah a million people died, but maybe that was actually the lesser of two (or a thousand) evils, and that's why he \"let it happen\".\n\nOf course, yes, maybe he IS evil, but I feel like it would make a lot less sense if he was evil imo.
Deciding that a million people should die to ensure a better future is exactly what caused everyone to say Dany was mad, and for her to be killed.\n\nSo why is it different when Bran does it? Because he knows for sure?\n\nIt\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a good answer.
Well, we never know.
A more positive interpretation is that he recognized that without him there as a compromise candidate, that meeting would have ended in another war.
Is it possible Bran was just referring to the wheelchair bound month long journey it takes to get to KL from WF? Surely he went down south knowing they would have to determine a king or queen and that\u2019s what he could have meant by that. I\u2019m not entirely sure Bran is completely all knowing. I mean I won\u2019t deny he knows who will play important roles in future events and what not but are we really going to say Bran knows everything that is ever going to happen in the future?
I really can't see travel time being referenced by the writers of beyond the wall and Teleporto-pirate...
Well of course, I just prefer the Bran as villain-take on it
I have to admit a while ago someone else accidentally wrote Kongs Landing and it really made me laugh. I can\u2019t help but refer to it as Kongs Landing now.
Even in conversation now I can\u2019t help but refer to it as Kongs Landing. Someone mentioned Cersei Lannister throwing barrels out of the red keep and it\u2019s an image I can\u2019t get out of my mind!
If that's the case, then the writing was still terrible. If the 3ER had some sinister plan all along to take the throne then they should at least have explained who he was
I agree it should have been explained which is why I\u2019m hopeful it will be explained in a prequel. I hate thinking they would take advantage of the viewer by leaving us with this hole, but the only explanation I can think of is they are saving that story. Otherwise, it is just crappy writing. \nThe only positive thing I can think of about leaving it unexplained is it allows the viewer to create their own story and fans to supply some amazing fan fiction/theories. Now that it\u2019s ended I will miss reading all the theories on this subreddit. It added an element to the show that I really enjoyed and isn\u2019t common among most shows. But that isn\u2019t for everyone so I understand the disappointment many have.
Where has it ever been said that the 3ER has the ability of seeing possible future outcomes?
I don\u2019t think it has,  but he has seen flashes of future events. When he was north of the wall searching for the 3ER he had a vision that showed a dragons shadow flying above KL and I believe in another vision he saw the Sept of Baelor explode before it happened. The 3ER really never been fully explained. So I am in error I do not know he sees all possibly outcomes. That was a far stretch on my part.  He would be able to see the past though which would have helped him decide that a Brandon was the right choice. That is only if the previous 3ER already knew of Jon\u2019s heritage. Did all the previous 3ER memories transfer to Bran? I guess if we knew that maybe we could understand the 3ER motives more?
Who said that Bran isn't Bran any more? Bran.\n\nWho then said \"Yes I am totally Bran, King Bran* actually?\" Bran.\n\nYou're taking one thing that he said as gospel while ignoring his later decisions. I can see why you'd do that, because Bran/the show as written doesn't make any sense and we're trying to make sense of it, but that's not what it is.
You\u2019re right I am taking one thing he said and making it gospel,  but I\u2019m also looking at his behavior. It really does seem after he became the 3ER that Bran does not exist anymore. For me I see Brandon Stark and Bran/3ER as different characters. There seems so little of Bran left after he became the 3ER. Unfortunately, it\u2019s left to the viewer to try and figure it out because it wasn\u2019t given time to be explained.  At least it gives us fan theories to read, but it does leave us feeling unsatisfied.
Those responses could have been the 3ER lying.
I didn't interpret it like that. He's still Bran, just not the Bran everyone knew. He's the Three Eyed Raven, but hes still \"Bran Stark\". Like...think of it in the sense that Sansa season 8 is NOT Sansa season 1. Then exemplify that by like a thousand. That's how I thought of Bran when he told people like Meera that he wasn't \"Bran\".
Yeah I think it\u2019s probably a flaw in the writing, but nevertheless it\u2019s there in the script. \u201cWhy do you think I came all this way?\u201d\nUnintentional subtext: \u201cTo be King! My plan worked! Push Danny\u2019s buttons until she snaps, let duty bound Jon kill her off and then roll in as the leader of the seven (sigh, six) kingdoms.\u201d \nRewatching the show from this perspective will really change your views on Bran\u2019s journey I think.
The \"Bran is evil\" theory relies on some really weird beliefs about the quality of D&D's writing.\n\nIn order for it to work, their writing is bad enough that the \"true\" resolution of the main plot is only conveyed through a particular interpretation of 2-3 vague things that Bran says and a particular interpretation of his vaguely defined powers, all of which completely runs against the tone of the end of the episode\n\nAND\n\ntheir writing is also good enough that the interpretation of these few lines isn't just the unintended implication of the few lines that they wrote.
lol if he shut his mouth about Jon's heritage none of this would have happened
\"It's your choice, Jon\"\n\n\"The future is written\"\n\nSo the guy who knows the future is written also tells a dude that he has a choice?
Maybe something even worse would have happened. Dany's madness seems to have been an inevitable development, so is it better to let a single city burn or save it but then Dany goes mad years down the line when she's got an empire stretching across 2 continents comprising tens of millions of people?
But Varys actively tried to stop it.
Well according to the survey 88% of people saw that.
Same. Plus that badass never lost a battle. What a stud.
He was a lot more of a dumbass in the show though. He just fell in love and abandoned his vow instead of choosing Jeyne's honor over his own after a moment of weakness when he found out his brothers were murdered. \n\nThe parallels to Ned sacrificing his own honor were a lot more satisfying.
Ned?
[deleted]
What about Ned? He might've been an honorable fool, but he knows how to keep a damn secret. Robb broke his oath and got his family and men killed.
You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain.
Should have just married the Frey girl.
Long Live Robb!
They kind of forgot about spellcheck.
Too bad Game of Thrones is over or they could all have bright futures writing for the show
Not as if they are being paid millions to do it though
Or they dont actually know english because they **dont speak english** besides Google Translate English :P

It's not impossible to do at all. There are software that does this instantly with a click of a button, nVivo for example, possibly many others that are open source.
we kind of forgot about that
Are you talking about the viewers or the writers!?
yes
BuT iT wOuLd Be A tOuChInG mOmEnT
Seems like a lot of people assume the plot is going to make as little sense as the plot has made previously
Then why is everyone mad?
Especially the writers of the show \ud83d\ude48
IMO Arya has like 10% chance of even getting back to Westeros
Bran had like 0.01% chance to become King. Arya won't just be coming back, she'll tow Westereros back east with her boat.
\"You underestimate my plot armour!\"
Arya is going to die at sea. Everyone who has ever sailed west has never come back. Unless, of course, her plot armor will protect her, but if she was anyone else, she'd die.
Probably because the rulers are the two characters people care the least about. They want to see a Jon & Arya reunion though.
Of course that was the reason. People thinking with emotion and not actually answering thequestion.
Lol they\u2019re other sides of the planet, and Bran and Sansa rule the only two kingdoms in Westeros and have plenty to discuss for terms. How is the former meeting even remotely as likely as the second meeting.
The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Holy Roman Empire were bastions of peasant liberty and political stability, dontcha know? /s
\\^This comment will not receive the deserved number of upvotes.
Not going to comment on the Commonwealth as I do not know much about it, but the HRE had lots of things that were better than in the absolute kingdoms surrounding it. For example it had a semi-independent judiciary, it had free cities that were on equal footing with nobility and who could conduct their own affairs and (admittedly after huge wars) it had a degree of religious tolerance that was missing from England, Spain and France.
Couldn't help but read that as stab-ility and thought, you know what that still works.
If anything the elective monarchy would cause more problems and mean there\u2019s going to most likely be a war every time the king dies
\"The Wheel\" has always been ambiguous and stupid. Does it mean literally what Dany said where the switching of families on the throne crushes the common people? Families only ever switched once, though. Does it mean different families fighting for power, rather than the throne directly? Does it mean the way nobles treat commoners? How was anyone meant to break it? What Dany going to end all houses and rule alone? Was she going to execute any differing opinions? How would she stop scheming?\n\nNothing about it made sense.
Her speech hinted at an \"Enlightened monarchy\" and that is the only explanation that makes sense. \"The Wheel\" is as abstract as the \"Game of Thrones\" and it really looks like both are the same. Breaking the wheel at least promised taking the power from the Great houses. The reign she promised at least isn't a tyranny against commoners but having consolidated power under her breaking the feudal structure.\n\nNow with the elective monarchy the game to reach the top will become even bigger and stronger. So the wheel isn't broken but is replaced with a bigger, stronger wheel.
the last 3ER lived for like 150 years, and died because of the NK not of natural causes. it seems 3ER are almost immortal.
Because a big part of the wheel was the concept of ownership of the throne based on bloodline. Whether or not an elective monarchy would run more smoothly, that toxic idea was eliminated, with the exclamation point being Jon not getting it as the undisputed last heir.
But Bran is immortal. They have a far greater problem now. A King that can see any rebellions or attempts to usurp him coming
But that will cause more LittleFinger and Varys characters to appear and manipulate on who to become kings. And when they'll not like the king anymore, guess who's getting the poison?
But the system is still broken. Each house will still continue on the same concept and more power struggle will arise within the regions and houses as each house have a shot at the highest position. The new system is hardly innovative as the Iron Islands has the same system and it didn't work better for them.
How do you think the Paramounts will be chosen? How do you think the King in the North will be chosen?\n\nOwnership based on bloodline is still strong and that\u2019s assuming that Brans \u201celective monarchy\u201d actually stays stable, which I seriously doubt.
sources?
Also you have a monarch that has all-seeing powers. Big Brother, can see everything, and every citizen is under constant surveillance. He let King's Landing burn, and he will definitely abuse that power.
One would think that the fact that the only elective monarchy in Westeros chose none other than EURON as their King would serve as a hint against this system.
If you put Tywin in at the end of the show, it would be a Lannister monarchy within a month.
especially in this last season,  it seemed much more of a catch phrase that any type of firm plan of the future.  \n\nWhen she is inspiring the crowd and tries to get a chant going 'will you help me break the wheel'  my reaction was 'what does that even mean?'\n\nClearly, it meant to take her armies (dothraki back to horde size, and the reformed unsullied) and conquer all known lands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9Bo89m2f6g\n\nShe clearly explained it.\n\nI'm just not sure how anyone thinks it is broken
To be honest, the only way to \"break the wheel\" in this god-forsaken world is exactly what Dany was planning. If everyone is kept in line through fear, there won't be any wars or backstabbing. Dany made an example out of the people of KL, so if she actually became Queen and took over the world, people would understand what would happen to them if they attempted to revolt. She'll literally bring hell-fires down on you, as she's proven she'll go as far as she needs to go. What she did to KL tells the people that she's not afraid to kill whoever she needs to (innocent or otherwise) in order to keep the people in-line.\n\nIf she ruled the world with an Iron Fist, there would be no wars and everyone would listen to her out of fear. That's what I call \"breaking the wheel\", at least in the world of ASOIAF. If one Lord attempts to rise up against her, Drogon will literally melt their keep and kill their entire family and they won't be able to do anything about it. Very effective leadership tactic in this world imo. Daenerys Stormborn will bring her wrath whenever she needs to, which is effectively breaking the wheel.
The dothraki: \"is the queen dead? Good, whew, now we can go back to being law abiding citizens\"
The show just kind of forgot about the Dothraki.
The Dothraki just kind of forgot they all died at Winterfell, and like a Loony Tunes character when they realized they all instantly died again.
But why would he care if all the Kingdoms came down on them? They're the unsullied, facing certain death without flinching is kind of their thing.\n\nAnd why call/wait for the council at all? Why not just execute them straight away? They had Jon and Tyrion in the dungeon for weeks before all the lords arrived.
Well because Greyworm isn't *really* an Unsullied anymore. After meeting Missandei, he had all the same feelings any other character did.\n\nHe was more interested in protecting Naath for Missandei probably. After the rage of Dany's death, then the acceptance a few weeks later, I'm sure he understands
Jon definitely knew she had done wrong way before Tyrion mentioned his sisters. That\u2019s why he stopped fighting in the streets when she was burning the city.
Jon was so poorly written that it's hard to know who he was anymore. This season he seems to be utterly stupid and too in love with Dany to think clearly. At least that's what the show was pushing. He said he himself he didn't know what he'd do if he was Dany on top of Drogon in that moment. Yeah, I don't get it either. The Jon we all knew would have reacted differently. But this is season 8 where characters we knew don't make any sense anymore.
Yet in the next episode we get him arguing for her for 5 minutes before coming to his senses.
Even then Tyrion did care but he wasn't willing to make the sacrifice of abandoning his evil and bloodthirsty house and family for it until it was his life at stake.
Read the post again. They brought up democracy as an *example* of breaking the wheel. They're saying Dany's definition of the wheel remains intact after the finale.
Chill out, Marx. I'm just saying the wheel of elite families ruling over the little people hasn't changed in a television show
The wheel is the never ending changing of power from one person to another. The wheel can never be broken but the process in which who is selected to have that power can be. No longer is the changing of power happening by force but by selection. Dany was just another spoke on the wheel.
Oooo how I miss college.
She literally nothing personal kid-ed the NK.
\"Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru\" - Arya to the Night King.
personnel*
I enjoy anime and I'm certain Arya wasn't that...
felt little weird that Arya didn't use face swapping since they spent so much time for that training before. would also have been neat if Arya could've gotten near NK using some of that trick.
Exactly
How would that trick have worked against the NK? I can't think of a way. What face in her bag would have allowed her to casually get next to the NK without him or his generals knowing something was up? When you kill a WW they disintegrate so there's no face peeling ritual she can perform to look like a white walker.
I'm personally thinking the South is going to face an economic collapse and revolts soon if Bronn remains Master of Coin, but yeah the weather is better so I'd rather live there. But if the North was warmer I'd probably like to hang out in Winterfell.
I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
Bruh this kind of logic doesn't exist in the world post-ending anymore, given the lord of the other six kingdoms literally didn't have their own interests in mind at the time of Bran's crowning.
I guess the North would also pick their own ruler then? But there wold be no stark in winterfell. I honestly don't know why I care anymore anyway...
Arya would be Sansa's immediate heir, but she might be a bit difficult to reach.
I'm pretty sure men always inherit before women in every Kingdom except for Dorne, both inherit on equal grounds and the Iron Islands, in which they have their own funny little election and offerings.\n\nSo Sansa's immediate heir would be Bran. Infact, Sansa only got to be \"King/Queen in the North\" because the title didn't exist at the time and the northeners had to choose someone to lead them.\n\nOnce Sansa passes away, the title is no longer up for \"re-election\" but will instead pass on to her offspring, and in case she doesn't have offspring, her siblings and then their nephews.
I voted Arya and Jon because of the bad writing. If the show was as internally consistent or as politically savvy as the earlier seasons then Sansa and Jon or Sansa and Bran are the obvious choices.  The show no longer makes sense so I think Jon and Arya reuniting is more likely because it would be a surprise and an emotional beat for the audience.
We really don\u2019t know that. If we had access to the raw data we could look at that, and it might indeed be interesting. But speaking for myself, I complained very vocally about bad writing and I picked Bran and Sansa to reunite.
There are way more people who liked this episode (30% rated it 8+) than votes on even the most popular reunion (13%).
That's not how anonymous surveys work
There is a YouTuber named JonTron
I read somewhere that he was dying and in the process of turning but was stabbed in the heart with dragonglass by the children of the forest
Realizes she is not no one, but a Stark. Gets back home, immediately frees her wolf, tells her family she will never see them again. A lot of characters feel like in earlier season their character had progression and in 8 they had regression.
Either maisie williams or the character herself has gotten her ego inflated because she walks around in every episode like she's the fucking shit and it really annoys me

Literally dies and is brought back for what?  Bending the knee or killing Dany (which someone else easily could've done)
I guess he was brought back to get Dany. Nobody else from the north would have tried to seek her out. So he was a big part of why the NK was killed.
Jon and Dany were both tools for the lord of light. Jons purpose was to unite fire and ice in order to defeat the night king, which undoubtedly would not have happened without those dragons. Once that purpose was fulfilled, he needed to remove fire from the equation as no one should have that kind of power. Which he did and then he was freed to go live a duty free life in the wild. He fulfilled everything the lord of light intended him to. It was necessary for him to be targ because it would have been difficult for anyone else to eliminate dany with her dragon protecting her. His targ blood made it possible for him to get past drogon.
He was brought back because, as hinted heavily in the books, he\u2019s meant to stop the white walker threat. However, readers put this together years ago and d&d wanted to subvert expectations so they rewrote the story and made Arya the one to kill the NK... even though it makes zero fucking sense.
I feel like people are being purposefully ignorant when they say this, if not for Jon the wildlings are likely executed, Ramsey continues to rule the North, Daenerys never even considers the Great War, the Night King probably destroys Westeros. And he stops Dany from destroying the planet.\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t even need to be all of that, it could\u2019ve just been a little thing. Pretty sure there\u2019s a bit of dialogue about it before the Battle of Bastards. \u201cWhy did he bring me back?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe for a higher purpose. Or Maybe he brought you back just to die again today.\u201d \u201cWhat cruel kind of god is that?\u201d \u201cThe one we\u2019ve got.\u201d
> Viserion spits fire at him, he hides behind a rock, survives (this is even more ridiculous when you see what Drogon did to King's Landing)\n\nWe even see Viserion's fire destroy the walls of Winterfell just minutes before this scene
> Grey Worm doesn't kill him immidiately when he finds out he killed his Queen, even though he slaughtered Lannister soldiers for much less \n\nSo much this. The characters change their attitude in 0,5 secondes.
I think Jon has had the most plot armor out of any character, even more than Arya.  He should have logically died Gods know how many times after he actually did die.  In Battle of the Bastards, Beyond the Wall and The Long Night he should have died countless times.  At least in BOTB and BTW he didn't get saved by \"let's cut away to another scene\"
Drogon should have tried to burn him, even with the required retcon.  That could have given a reason for Drogon and company to not kill him but then you have his \"story\" being even more better than Bran's.
Drogon's main attack gets +80 explosive vs stone, while Undead Viserion has a passive blizzard, an AoE ability which slows nearby enemies.
>Drogon doesn't kill him even though he killed his mom\n\nHe's a Targaryen. There's a pretty strong indication that dragons inherently bond with Targaryens.\n\n>Grey Worm doesn't kill him immidiately when he finds out he killed his Queen, even though he slaughtered Lannister soldiers for much less\n\nGrey Worm seems conditioned to only act on orders from authority. The executions were on Dany's orders. Notice how when Bran put his foot down (figuratively speaking) as king, Grey Worm quieted down and followed his orders.
Targaryen dragons killed other Targaryen during their civil war. Dragons only bond with one rider.
And only killed the Waif after getting three fatal stab wounds from her in three seconds followed by an abdomen full of rank harbor bacteria.
Actually annoyed me because Drogo was killed by a small, infected wound showing that people no matter their strength can succumb to nature. Meanwhile someone who's less physically fit with worse wounds, is thrown somewhere that's extremely likely to contain harmful bacteria, and is perfectly fine rather quickly after minor treatment of the wound.
It was two stabs with a small knife in the lower right abdomen where there are no vital organs.  Infection was a possibility but not guaranteed.  I find the Hound's survival less likely than Arya's but people don't go on and on about that.
Show Arya is pretty fantastic in the first four seasons, but honestly suffers the most from season 5 and beyond. The Braavos shit is so, horrifyingly awful.
Show Arya's story went to shit in S6 and never recovered
Show Arya is my favorite. I don\u2019t like her in the books.
I still think it would of been a better choice to leave the night king to Jon, but have Arja kill Dany. In episode 5 with Arja being in the thick of the carnage, I was sure they were setting it up so she was going to kill Dany.\n\nThan again, I would of prefered Jorha to have to kill Dany, that would of been something.
I weirdly wanted her to find Melisandre's necklace and take over her position!
I honestly kept on expecting a faceless assassin to kill her at some point so that they could at least do something relevant.
That was not Arya's whole arc.\n\nEdit.  Added \"whole\".
Her getting poisoned back in Braavos and then somehow surviving because Lady Crane found her lying on the floor would make more sense than having her surviving major stab wounds in her stomach and still being able to run around and swim, like what the fuck.\n\nThe faceless men aren't even known to be stabby. They always make their kills look like accidents.
This is what pisses me off so much with Arya's storyline. I feel like she basically scammed the faceless men but everyone just acts like she completed her training and is one of them now, even though she still retains her identity, like you can't have both. Arya's story would've been way more interesting if they fully committed to her losing her identity in trying to seek vengeance but the showrunners  just wanted to play up to everyone's love of Maisie Williams.
Yea, the internet turns people into irrational hate machines.  But the hate for Arya is mild compared to for others.  Arya is the best.
It seems to have taken over Reddit after the finale and is in direct contrast to the Reddit polls.  So, I think it\u2019s a vocal minority.
I don't know about the books, but I disagree with this notion that the bullet points of the ending were fine, only the execution sucks.\n\nIn the context of the show, Bran becoming king, Daenerys going crazy and Jaime going back to Cersei are horribly unsatisfying endings. \"Oh, but Game of Thrones is not a fairytale!\"\n\nI'm not asking for fan-service, but these endings aren't bittersweet, they're downright sadistic. Daenerys' whole arc, in my view, is about her learning how to be a leader, and to reject her family's troubled history and legacy, and build her own. Does she have to end up on the throne? Not necessarily, but how does a character that has surrounded herself with multiple counselors and constanly asked for advice can have \"goes batshit insane, whatever\" as a satisfying conclusion? Why not use the fact that Jon is not only a Targaryen himself, but actually knew one (Maester Aemon) as a way to show her \"hey, not all Targaryens are conquerors or crazy, huh\"?\n\nAnd I've seen people bring up that Jaime is like an addicted who wants to get rid of it, but can't. Fine, I get the point, but... that's not narratively satisfying. You can't just have a \"tragic\" ending like that just for the sake of it. Have him kill Cersei and die in the process, it's not rocket science.\n\nThe execution was a tragedy, but the bullet points were very underwhelming too, or downright nonsensical in Bran's case. Again, at least on the context of the show, don't know about the books. Maybe it makes sense there.
> And I've seen people bring up that Jaime is like an addicted who wants to get rid of it, but can't. Fine, I get the point, but... that's not narratively satisfying. You can't just have a \"tragic\" ending like that just for the sake of it. Have him kill Cersei and die in the process, it's not rocket science.\n\nExcept that what you just said completely changes it from being tragic to palatable. It's not supposed to be easily palatable, it's supposed to leave a bad taste in your mouth, that's part of the tragedy. Jaime is like a character that has struggled with heroin for 8 seasons, and finally manages to break free in season 7, but when death is imminent you see him reach for one last hit and fall back into his addiction right before a meteor hits his house and kills him. It's bittersweet and tragic because you learn that in the end he never truly broke free of his addiction, but in the very end at least he was happy with his drug, and more tragedy because you wonder if his heroin was the only thing that ever made him feel happy, and that's why he chose it at death's door.
This is an adaptation issue and it does not make sense in the show because of how many characters and plot-lines are changed/omitted.  I fully believe these are the broad strokes of Martin's ending. The entire series was inspired by and starts with Bran's story so I believe him becoming the King is very believable in the context of the books, but came out of the left field on the show because D&D can't flesh things out like Martin does. Bran and Jon's stories are flipped on its head. Jon is the Aragorn figure with the Frodo ending while Bran is the Frodo figure with the Aragorn ending. \n\nAs for Dany, her arc was always very ominous, and there's plenty of hints in the books that she will eventually succumb to her Fire and Blood impulses, but not necessarily lose her mind like the show implied - which I think is an oversimplification of her downfall. She tries to overcome her nature of Fire and Blood by surrounding herself with advisors, but in the end, despite her attempts to make it work that just does not make her happy. Peace did not give her her ideal world - she had to reopen the fighting pits and agree to the return of slavery in the name of peace. She had to tolerate what she sees as injustice because she tried to make peace work, but it just doesn't, not for her.\n\nDany has a strong belief in her own moral code and has a giant savior complex. To her, she truly believes what she is doing is right, and if Fire and Blood is the only way she can \"save\" others and make her ideal world happen, then so be it. She decided in her very last chapter that it was time to embrace Fire and Blood, otherwise she will get nowhere. \"If I look back, I am lost\". \n\nI think the reason why people felt betrayed by Dany's heel turn, aside from the very rushed season 7-8, was the omission of the entire fake Aegon Targaryen plot line in the books. I think this will be sort of similar to her plot line with Jon in the show. fAegon will be seen as a good king, a glimmer of hope after he deposes mad queen Cersei, but Dany comes in with her army of rapers and pillagers, exiles like Tyrion and Jorah and three nukes. She sees herself as a \"savior\". But the people of Westeros don't need saving. There are no chains for her to break. Here, she's just another invader, and in Westeros she can only rule through Fire and Blood.
Totally agree.  They should have abandoned the book endings and written a good ending for the show.  These plot points were never going to work in the show no matter how many more episodes they added.
I think George will be able to do it with the final two books, but I do think it\u2019s incredibly hard to wind all of his narrative to the ending in a meaningful way which is why it\u2019s taking so long to write. The show felt very much like it glossed over all the details, so while enough the ending had enough content to make it feasible understandable, it didn\u2019t feel earned.
Yeah, I completely agree. I think that the story COULD have been fine if they would have done it the way they used to, slow and methodical. They really needed more seasons to wrap things up the way they wanted to. This way it just felt rushed and really badly executed. \n\nSeriously, this season has episodes where more big events or character twists occur than the entirety of season three or four.
He\u2019s not doing 3 books it\u2019s 2. Hell we might not even get 2 anyway.
Oh I know he is saying it is 2... I just feel like I would be astonished if it didn't turn into 3, based on how much left there is to cover. It started out as a trilogy... then 4 books... then 6... now it is supposed to be 7, but I feel like even if WoW comes out, GRRM will at some point tell us he actually is gonna need 8 books to finish the story.
I can understand that perspective, but I do think this is different than a show such as Lost or Dexter for example where the ending was conceptually unsatisfying. At least for me, the part of GOT final season that I didn\u2019t feel satisfied with was the lack of character development, meaningful dialogue, and conflict that brought the show there. It felt more like the shallow cliff notes version of the ending, which is upsetting after having so much depth to the earlier seasons. That being said, I was far more ok with how the story ends than I was with how it was told.

Like how The Long Night trivializes most of Jon's arc involving WW.
The four most intriguing story lines (Jon, Bran, Arya, NK) due to their potential outcomes will now be meaningless filler due to their actual outcome. Wtf even is this season. They somehow blew a 4-0 lead in a 7 game series. Seems impossible but they fucking did it.
Please, I'll keep injecting Hardhome straight into my veins for years to come. \n\nWhat a fucking fantastic episode.
That\u2019s like saying Eisenhower didn\u2019t do shit in WWII cause the Soviets killed Nazi.
Just because he didn't get to stab the main villain doesn't mean his WW arc is trivialized. He's still most responsible for uniting Westeros against the White Walker threat. Not to mention the major role he plays in the rest of the season.
Arya killing him is fine with Me. Jon\u2019s arc was about getting everyone together and leading the fight. He did that.
They always felt like filler to me anyway. Bran's scenes during the show were easily my least favorite. Hell, I barely even remember any of it, just dreading when the inevitable next Bran scene would be where they are all still aimlessly walking north having some meaningless dialog. \n\nArya was, in general, a great character, but she definitely had her share of filler, too. Her scenes in the House of Black and White for instance were awful. The 4th or 5th time you see her being abused and/or being ignored by Jaqen were more than enough.
The end pretty much makes irrelevant like 60-70% of the show
I\u2019m going to be so mad rewatching everything happening with Bran. He goes through so much shit, and other people around him are killed or have their minds broken to keep him alive, only to have whatever interesting mysticism linking him with the wierwood trees, the night king, the wall, the warging etc. go completely unresolved. The whole magic side of the show was left as dozens of loose ends in favor of an Arya sneak attack, then Bran who\u2019s been entirely disconnected by choice from the human political drama swoops in at the last second to become king for no reason; with no basis for why he would want it or why the rest of the lords would support him.
You could say the same about all the Margaery stuff, but in that case it doesnt feel like filler, just like a much much better exposition about how not every character will live out his whole arc
A lot of scene of other characters will start to feel like filler I bet. Problem is a ton of Bran scenes were boring before this and now they are infuriating.
Rewatching would be depressing, the first scene of the entire series is now a parody!
That makes sense honestly. Episode 2 had some super cool scenes (like Brienne's knighting) that are amazing because they are \"supposedly\" the last time you'll see all these characters alive and together. Then Episode 3 comes along, nobody in that scene dies, the Night King wasn't really that big of a deal, and all of a sudden, the previous episode loses a lot of love because much of it didn't mean anything.
Yeah, they were good, but as a setup for what came after it, they are now basically worthless...\n\nThat's also why I feel like the whole season's rotten rating looks too high now. Boosted by some ultimately insignificant setup episodes, while the ultimate payoff is rotten as can be
Speaking the truth.
Yes, I noticed that too. This downward trend started with episode 3, since then the scores have dropped lower and lower for all the episodes.
Which is fucking stupid, it\u2019s just petty brigading driven by spite. Rank the last 3-4 episodes lower all you want.
Well there's 2 reasons i can think of for that. In isolation those episodes were decent and this rated fairly highly. But after the last 4 episodes they ultimately became pretty pointless beacuse nothing really happend to further the plot.\n\nThen there's also the part of the fanbase that just retroactively downvotes everything beacuse they're angry with the finale. Like i absolutely hated the finale or atleast how things went down, i'm not gonna go back and retroactively reduce ratings like that.
I've been watching that too. We're .1 point away from not having a single episode at 8 or higher. Fascinating to watch.
Yeah... personally I skip all Ned scenes, Robb Scenes and Oberyn scenes on my rewatches...  because all that matters about ANYTHING is how it ends,  not how it lives.\n\nyeah, no.   the Night King mattered, certainly not as much as he should have, but he mattered, he killed the previous three-eyed Raven, essentially forging Bran,  wiped out the last of House Umber and Karstark, nearly genocided the wildlings, united  Jon and Daenerys armies against him,  killed a dragon, caused a good portion of the losses that caused Daenerys to go off the deep end.  and would have wiped out the entire world if not for the (admittedly clumsy) culmination of Arya's training, because Dany's army with its tens of thousands of Dothraki, Thousands of Unsullied and two dragons BARELY won, nothing would have had a chance after that, which was the trap the story fell into.\n\nJon's lineage tipped the scales of Dany's choices, her entire reason for 'choosing fear' was that Jon was clearly the more loved of the valid candidates,  his arc also emphasised the idiocy of divine right, Jon's last leadership role ended with him being stabbed to death.   it was never about his right to be king, it was always about how he neither wanted to be a king, nor was he the best suited.   his entire story was about the shift from being a bastard pariah to finding a place where he belonged, mattered and could be important to people,  he was completely swayed to the Freefolk lifestyle back in Season 3, only rejecting it out of moral obligation to the Night's Watch,\n\nthe a huge portion of the story is contingent on lies, false narratives and the conflict they cause.  the story that Rhaegar kidnapped Lyanna incited the events that culminated in Robert's rebellion,  the lies of Joffrey's parentage propagated the war of five kings,  to have Bran's ultimate destiny be that of the King who can see through these falsehoods is a strong thematic hook, it just isn't handled very well.   it doesn't ruin his story in retrospect.
Thank you. I winced with embarrassment when angry joe said Jon\u2019s lineage and resurrection didn\u2019t matter at all. Whether you enjoyed the series and execution or not, that\u2019s simply objective nonsense at best.
Yeah nobody rates shit like the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie lower just because the later ones were shit
Don't worry mate, winter is only a couple of episodes :)
[deleted]
Still cold
this is what I thought! nearly everyone agreed on bran knowing what was going to happen and still letting thousands of thousands of people get burned alive so he could sit on the throne (or just on his wheelchair by whatever is left of drogon's anguish). so why why why would anyone want to live under his rule? I think I'd rather have sansa as my queen, as she does seem to have at least some experience with these politics.
It is better to be under someone's rule like that, than to be against them.\n\nIf he were letting thousands of people die with that decision, then how many people do you think he is letting die with Winterfell's newfound independence?\n\nThe little sociopath probably knows that The North doesn't have the means to keep itself fed through winter and would rather give them their independence so that they starve to death, rather than have them stick around and be a burden to the rest of the realm.
Right. She also has the experience with the logistics of ruling. \n\nHowever, I am honestly not a huge fan of her either.\n\nJon: I need you to keep a secret.\nSansa: Ok.\nAlso Sansa: Hey Tyrion...
Does it really matter? As a commoner I'd probably live a life of whatever no matter who reigns so I'd rather live a place where it is warm.
I imagine some of the people in Kings Landing felt similarly, and Bran did nothing to stop it. \n\nIn fact, I could argue he was a contributing factor to it happening.
The only good reply I've really gotten. I hate being cold too
I wanna live in Dorne with all the bisexuals!
Also, how the hell does Westeros have control of the wall when it's in the north now?
Or being a total bitch to the Lord of the Riverlands - a region that until that moment were entirely devoted to answering the call for the Starks whenever they were in need.\n\nShe doesn't make alliances - she breaks them.
Or openly asking for independence from your brother in front of the rulers of the other Kingdoms, essentially ensuring future revolts.
The funny thing is, in terms of a rewatch, the Lannisters are by far the best to see their arcs again. Cersei literally having her house of cards fall on her. Jaime having a all too realistic relapse (it seems weird on a show, but this is exactly what addiction is like, and it's often never depicted this well) and Tyrion actually having the bittersweet ending of having a high power he doesn't want.
Plus, the big woman. And I hear she's single now.
Edmure shouldn't have spoken.  He has had nothing to offer the world besides his value as a hostage for years.  His sad sack performance at Riverrun tells you all you need to know about him
Oh yeah right, he should've let his infant child and his men be slaughtered, sure.
Yep. It's a little vindication. \n\nI really, really wish it had gone otherwise, though.
Oh yeah, I totally agree. The big thing for me is that I never really got time to dislike or question Daenerys. She was a little cold at times, but out of nowhere she torches kings landing? And they never really actually show her on the dragon once she is destroying everything. I found it hard to connect the action to her. \n\nThen 5 minutes later she is dead. It was too much too quickly.
Yeah I would give practically anything to have the series finished out strong. It was in contention for my favorite series of all time and now it can\u2019t really hold a candle to them.
Honestly, only the second episode had any real depths to it. The scene where Brienne got knighted and Pod sang is so darn good. \n\nOverall the character interactions was more than shallow one-liners.\n\nBy far the best episode this season, and the only episode I'd call good.
I wholeheartedly agree. By the time we got to the small council meeting I was pretty much over the one liners. \n\nThe second episode had some great depth (relatively) to it. It was also genuinely funny with the giants milk story lol
Why, because than you feel justified to have an opinion?
I wouldn't say that. It does make me feel more justified IN my opinion. \n\nIt also gives me people that have similar feelings to talk to about it.\n\nAnd some of the people that have spoken out against the season as a whole, have donated a good chunk of change to Emilia's charity which may or may not have happened otherwise.

> And who the fuck is Aaron Rodgers\n\nif you're actually serious he's the Packers quarterback and he was an extra in episode 5
Only 11%? Damn people here really are way to generous to this last season.
Hahahahaha, dude that was HILARIOUS! Game of Thrones is bad!!!
Always? Absolutely not. Up until ep4 where Rhaegal died the majority of the people were pretty satisfied with the show.
Yup, but I think FFN is where all the dany haters ended up
So... we should tune out everyone who's online and well informed? Sure. I'll ask my grandmother.   \n\nAnd also- have you not seen Facebook, twitter and instagram? The amount of hate there surpasses this.
> If Ned Stark's execution happened in this season, it would be described as \"trashy\" and \"lazy writing\".\n\nIf Ilyn Payne jumped off a balcony in King's Landing and stabbed Ned while saying something super edgy because he kinda forgot he had no tongue, yeah.

I would say most (albeit not all) of what happens in the finale is consistent with the show narrative, but somehow it seems this sub is not accepting a *single* thing about the ending. It's all shit.
I don't think it's stranger than any other character this season or the previous one.\n\nI just think it's weird the voters clearly love her but the comment section reflects the opposite
Comment sections are always cancerous.   Look at any comment section anywhere online and its the same.  Hate is a strong emotion and people want to vent.  And the internet allows them a degree of anonymity so they say things that they would never say in person.
That\u2019s not what their comment was about.
This is probably the most show positive sub.
if you really believe that, I recommend subs like r/asoiafcirclejerk and r/DanAndDaveFanclub r/SansaWinsTheThrone (and probably other GoT Character Sub-subreddits). You will see that this sub is still extremely negative.
Well that's just silly.
Agreed. I think every ill with the season can be tied to the decision to the shorten the last two season.
It went from character driven stories to a plot driven narratives.  They took all those ending moments you point out (spinoffs) and then worked backwards to the first episode.
There has to be some fall out for this? If they had finished the show with the quality of the first 6 seasons they would have been gods in the directing/writing world, anyone with a movie or series to shoot would have given anything to have them involved. After how they treated this ending I would be apprehensive to give them any story I had written, what if they half ass the end again? What if they half ass the whole thing?\n\nThere was only 1 chance to do this show given how it started, no one is going to want to re do it as it would be compared to the original 6 season's and it would almost definitely fall short, you cant just re do the end in 10 years as thats stupid. \n\nAt the half way point of this show, with the quality that it was they had guaranteed this was the only chance to tell the story right and they didn't do it. Now it will always be not as good as it could have been, and I dont want them to get away with it.
What interests me is the connection with Star Wars now.  Disney must be in full damage control mode.  People are mad/disappointed in D&D and will likely take it out on Star Wars cause it's the only real action they can take against these two.
There should be but there is no god of justice, only the god of tits and wine.
I have no doubt that some HBO executives are punching themselves in the dick right now. Probably ganging up on the poor bastard who argued for the \"artistic freedom\" to allow D&D to finish the show the way they wanted to.
D&D really shouldn't be allowed to write any more. Imagine them utterly destroying other long-beloved franchises. This is worse than Michael Bay's version of stories.
Here, here! (applause)
D&D don't care.  Disney threw boatloads of cash and 4 star wars movies at them.
Judging by the viewer numbers, I highly doubt it.
uh... maybe not?  at least one higher up was complimenting them.  smh.
Has there been any comments about the ratings from HBO or D&D? Arguably the biggest show in TV just ended and I haven't really seen anything from the people in charge
>the end of episode 3\n\nFTFY
Yeah even though many fans weren\u2019t admitting it at the time the show died with the NK being inexplicably shanked out of nowhere by a character whose plot has had nothing to do with the Army of the Dead.  \n\nCersei and Euron were laughably contrived OP final bosses. What were the stakes once the NK was killed? Nothing, and that was the issue. Why should i care at all about the battle for the iron throne when Dany has been outrageously nerfed since 7.01? Not to mention she defeats the Lannisters in *exactly* the same way she could have done in 7.01. All her defeats in S7, the entire NK plot and battle of Winterfell - Lol yeah none of it mattered, all you need is Drogon to take the city
I agree. This was the episode that really cemented the fact that the show was beyond saving. They basically ruined one of they key plotlines of the entire series in a matter of minutes.
>the Wight Hunt in season 7\n\nFTFY
>all of episode 3
DURING episode 3. \n\nFTFY
>the end of Season 7\n\nFTFY
>the end of episode 3\n> FTFY\n\nThe start of Episode 3 \n\nFTFY
by episode 4 is essentially the same as the end of episode 3
Episode 3 tanked the show. It made all the previous seasons pointless. I was the biggest GoT fan up until episode 3, and then I just resorted to memes and leaks to be able to cope with the disappointment.
*season 5\n\nEdit: I originally put season 6 because at least season 5 had Hardhome, but even that doesn't rule out Dorne
The best episode of s8 is inarguably 2.
inarguably is a very funny word to use when it comes to opinions
Have a real discussion or any kind of real interaction between Dany and Jon, that explained her actions and made us actually think he liked her. \n\nShow the fallout of her death! How are you going to kill the arguably main character of a story and just skip over all of the fallout, show no emotional reactions from any of the characters except her dragon?\n\nHave Jon and Greyworm fight. They built up to it before this, and there's simply no way Greyworm would let Jon live. Or if they're not gonna fight, then *don't* show Greyworm executing prisoners right before this, because those two things don't make sense together. Either he kills prisoners or he doesn't, don't show both in the same episode with no explanation.\n\nDon't make Bran the king, goddamn. So dumb. Either Jon or Gendry are the king, or they just split up all of the kingdoms in this episode. If Jon's not the king, there should be a good political reason, not just \"These guys who are on their way out won't allow it, for the week that they're still on this continent\". Jon should've had a character-defining choice to make in the end, just like Arya did when she gave up her revenge on Cersei, just like Theon did when he died defending Bran. \n\nSansa's political arc should've paid off. Just asking for and being randomly given a kingdom is not Littlefinger-esque scheming; it's no better than the bratty wannabe queen from season 1. This was a complete failure in character development payoff. She should've used her hard-earned wiles to scheme for a better outcome for Jon or the kingdoms.\n\nBronn should be dead, come on. No way he should be lord of Highgarden.\n\nEtc. Etc. There was a lot of stupid stuff in this episode, from the minor to the major, even just off the top of my head.
Jon and Dany did have that interaction and it was more than i could have ever hoped for in one episode to explain her mindset. Not sure why you imply this didnt even happen.\n\nIll agree on the fallout and fight with Grey Worm, but the way they did it was good too because if youre gonna have a time jump it should be after a climactic moment. \n\nMore debate leading to Bran would have been nice but i think he was the perfect choice. \n\nI dont think the point of Sansas arc was to become a schemer, it was to becaome a leader and thats what she did. \n\nBronn was promised Highgarden, Tyrion gave his word. And Bronns point about how houses start was totally right, now this is the follow-through.
I think we all waited for that, and it never happened. And I don\u2019t understand the reasoning behind that. Why introduce story elements like that, just to never use them again?
That sub will make you lose your god damn mind, I swear to god your sanity will be questioned.
Ya I went way too far down the rabbit hole
Apparently, r/gameofthrones, the most favorite of the show are \u201cLawful Evil\u201d to them
That's the best GoT sub among all the madness.
They thought it was so bad that their rating system looped back around and they gave it a 10.
A few thousand people snapped and went mad perhaps?
the first 20mins were ok so its clearly not a 1. the rest was an absolute shit show so it got a solid 3 from me
I didn't even think the first 20 minutes were okay. They were so fucking baffling at every turn.\n\n* Maybe half of it is spent on Tyrion going to find Cersei and Jaime. I get it, he's looking for his siblings. You can still do that, but it didn't need to be literally 5 minutes of walking through streets and corridors, we could have opened the episode with that.\n* Apparently Cersei and Jaime would have been totally fine if they just didn't stand in the one specifically place where bricks fell down.\n* Excited to find out what was with Arya and that horse? Well, it wasn't important, because she just kind of shows up and watches Dany and the horse is nowhere to be seen.\n* Dany is apparently able to speak so loudly that thousands of screaming Dothraki can hear her clearly. I get that she's Dragonborn but she wasn't even shouting, dude.\n* I mostly thought the scene with Tyrion/Jon was okay, but fuck, Jon is REALLY resistant to say anything bad about the girl he dated for literally like *two episodes*, despite her killing what, half a million innocent people?\n* Dany talks like a lunatic and then gets stabbed after about 2 minutes. Cool. Also, Jon holds Dany as she's dying in the *absolute most awkward way possible* (see the picture for Question 4 in this survey). Seriously, it looked so fucking terrible! I haven't seen anybody else mention this but I'm sure people have.\n* Drogon is either apparently able to grasp the complexity of inter-continental politics and power struggles and destroys the throne as a reactionary measure because it is a symbol of power, or maybe he just really fucking hates chairs, who knows.\n* Oh, we time skipped, and apparently Grey Worm just walked Jon out of there for being a bad boy and killing literally the only person left he cares about after already showing himself to be a merciless killer at the start of the episode.\n\nAnd this is just the stuff that I was actually thinking *as I was watching*, there's more to nitpick if you go back and look at it. Honestly, in Episode 5 I mostly watched the episode and then at the end thought \"okay, well, that was pretty damn bad.\" In Episode 6 it was so bad I kept being pulled out of it because I was thinking \"this is just really fucking stupid.\"

So it\u2019s brainless to enjoy something others didn\u2019t now...?
The writing is the core of any show. If the writing isn't any good, nothing else matters. All other things are build upon that foundation.
Would you rate this episode 1/10?
I gave it a 1. In my opinion, no amount of quality acting or amazing production could redeem the horrendous plot and writing. I gave it a 1 because after years of being incredibly invested in this show, the conclusion was so bad that it didn\u2019t feel real.\n\nI got more emotional reading and thinking about theories in the months leading up to S8 than I got during season 8 itself. To me the entire thing just felt like bad fanfiction- too poorly written and illogical to be taken seriously.\n\nI felt nothing when Daenerys went mad. I felt nothing when Jon killed her. I rolled my eyes at Bran and Sansa being king and queen (in the north). I felt a sort of disconnected wtf when Arya killed the NK. Even when Rhaegal died I was mostly like \u201cwtf that makes no sense\u201d.\n\nAnd in many ways that is unfathomable to me. I was so invested in the show, before. Things that would happen could affect my mood all week. I was devastated when Robb died. My stress level and investment in the Mountain vs Oberyn was through the roof. I literally cried in relief when Daenerys escaped the Khals. I was sick to my stomach when Rickon died. \n\nSomehow this season turned me from being that person into someone that feels like \u201cwhatever, this is just frustratingly stupid\u201d for basically every single thing that happens. I think it was because this season really epitomized what has been gradually happening for the past couple seasons- it no longer feels like GoT is a show where actions have consequences. It used to feel so high stakes, like everything was connected to each other- even small actions in Essos would have their effects ripple across to set off chains of events in Westeros. \n\nBut now it just feels like they\u2019re drawing random events out of a hat for the ending. Aaaaand this week we got... drumroll... \u201cRhaegal is going to die, Braime is going to bang, aaaaand 3X dick jokes! Sorry for all those folks who were hoping for Cleganebowl. Tune in next week and remember, the more you tweet @Cleganebowl2019, the more entries it will get in next week\u2019s drawing!\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with me. But that is why, after some thoughtful consideration, I gave it a 1/10. To me, this was basically as bad as \u201cand then aliens invade\u201d. I would have preferred Bran waking up from a dream.
watching the dothraki charge was when my mind just zonked out and the series became a complete joke.  my mind just couldn't handle the utter stupidity of the writing.  watched the rest of the season in a stupor.  writing was utter shit.  so many people don't realize that that the whole battle was the equivalent of a modern army throwing away their guns and charging enemy machine guns with a knife.
So fucking overdramatic my god
The writing is 90% of the show, so a score of \"1\" makes sense.
cinematography = 10.  acting = 10.  music = 10.  directing = 10.  writing = -99.   minimum score 1.  math checks out.
Really?! The acting felt stiff and forced in many places (due to the bad writing). Sure, the visuals and musical score were good... but IMHO, writing is pretty damned important.
This sub really is vicious to the Sansa fans
She's the worst.
It baffles me also
Lol no, a vocal minority are vicious to Sansa fans. The VAST majority of this sub is unreasonably obsessed with her.
The people who read some of the books gave the episode the same rating as those who didn't read the books. It's quite literally in the poll. There's a bit of a discrepancy between these groups and those who have read all five books, but it's fairly normal for more hardcore fans to be less forgiving and way more critical.\n\nI read two of the books before the show was announced. I stopped reading when the show was announced because it's more fun to read a book after having seen the television show than the other way around. When you first read the source material, it's a lot easier to be dissapointed with the television adaptation because you'll have certain expectations. \n\nMeanwhile, when you first watch the adaptation, a lot of content in the books will still be new and fresh because you can't possibly fit all of that into a movie or series. So you'll be more focused on that and less on the comparison.
Yeah, that's an interesting point. I think it's because the last 2 books introduced characters and plotlines that D&D cut out of the show entirely. And now book readers are just realizing that cutting those things crippled the end-story a bit. So people who have read all 5 books are experiencing an extra disappointment that 75% of this sub won't ever know.\n\nEdit:\n> When you first read the source material, it's a lot easier to be dissapointed with the television adaptation because you'll have certain expectations.\n\nThis is spot on. This is why not reading the books is sometimes the better decision.
This is the first time I have ever connected myself to a book series that is incomplete. I have read through multiple times but only after I watched season 1. \n\n...our watch has begun.
And at least you gave them a shot. I am surprised at how many haven\u2019t read the books at all.
the first one, of course.  a friend gave it to me, saying it's the greatest fantasy book ever.  \nI didn't hate it because it was bad.  I thought it was incredible and a well written, realistic, political drama.  It just wasn't anything close to high fantasy, and I love the escape that high fantasy provides and don't mind the tropes.  it was way too gritty and realistic for me.\n\nI resisted watching it for 7 seasons, but that same friend insisted I watch, and I did, and was amazed, and then... well, you know.
Ughh haha it\u2019s hard to say, I would still rate the episode the same because everything was so rushed and undeveloped. But I think my answers to the specific questions regarding the breaking of the wheel and did the series finale change my opinion on the entire show etc differently. Because after being able to make sense of what happened. My opinions regarding the story as a whole changed. Where as right after I watched It I was still trying to figure out how these characters got from where they started the episode to where they where at when they finished It. So in that sense the episode/ season was still kinda shitty. Not everyone deep dives into what happened like us, so there are a lot of people out there that saw the ending and don\u2019t really understand It.
I tried to explain tyrion's trial to a friend that hasn't seen a single episode and I was amused about how stupid it is even if you remove all the complex character and relationships \n\nSoldier wants 2 prisoners executed but for some reason he waits for a trial, comes with prisoner 1 to the trial, no judge is present, prisoner 1 decides who is gonna be the judge for prisoner 2, the judge is literally the most useless person in the room now and decides that prisoner 1 will be excused and will now serve as his assistant and that prisoner 2 will go vacation with his friends and his pet, soldier thinks the punishment is fair and leaves\n\n\nAnd that doesn't even scratch the surface of how non sense this whole scene is
That Lord's council meeting was such a lazy way to end things. They had a prisoner choose the king, and he chose the wrong one.
> I tried to explain tyrion's trial to a friend that hasn't seen a single episode and I was amused about how stupid it is even if you remove all the complex character and relationships\n\nFor a second there I thought you were talking about Tyrion's trial in S4 and was very confused
Like would greyworm care who the new king is?? Why would he let Tyrion speak and choose a king?? Why were they even in the dragon pit to begin with.. to bargain for Jon or choose a king??
Why do you assume it was a trial? I got it as a council of heads of the most powerful houses. Didin't seem like a trial at all.
Howland Reed, the only dude that can verify Jon's heritage, doesn't mention him at all and votes for his weird cousin to be king that he has never met and who also fucked over his daughter. Jesus christ. Aye.
Yeah just this morning I thought \u201cWait why didn\u2019t we get a scene with Yara about Theon?.\u201d As far as we know she isn\u2019t even aware her brother died.
Why did Yara let Arya threaten her like that?
ugh, stop
I was surprised to even see her. Figured they had just forgotten about her. They did, however, forget about who Yara is and the fact that she had already been granted independence.
We don't tend to get that unless it's really pivotal main characters. Didn't really have any reaction to LF dying for example.
Why did Yara say nothing about independence after the North was granted it when that was the reason she allied with daenerys in the first place?
See, these are the issues I really can't get behind. I totally understand people who are saying that the execution these last few episodes felt really rushed. I totally agree. I didn't mind the ending so much as I did how rushed and confusing it all felt.\n\nWhat I don't get are complaints like yours. You are watching a show about dragons. There's already a lot of suspense of disbelief required. So how come it's too difficult to just assume that Yara has been informed about the faith of Theon offscreen? You can poke a lot of holes in nearly any TV show if you require the directors to put all those events on screen.
There honestly isn\u2019t one main character that you can argue their ending made logical and thematic sense. Dany is at close as it gets and that tells you all you need to know about how badly the other characters have been betrayed. I still can\u2019t get over that thread on here with 15k upvotes that was chastising viewers after 8.04 who thought Jaime was going back to Cersei because he loved her rather than to kill her. The denial was incredible...
Theon! Theon had a redemption arc and he completed it, going from trying to/pretending to kill the Stark boys to giving his life protecting Bran when it mattered most (as far as he knew anyway).\n\nArya almost had an arc. She made a choice in e5 to give up her quest for revenge and choose life and, presumably, family. Unfortunately that was not built up to and they also threw it away immediately when she abandoned her family in the next episode.\n\nBran... Who fucking knows.\n\nDany should've been faced with her choice: be merciful, or be the queen. Instead she became the queen and then also murdered tons of people for no reason, and then never explained it and then got shanked. They had all the necessary elements there for her complete arc and completely discarded them because they're incompetent.\n\nJon needed to have a choice between duty and love. When he killed Dany, that didn't really come off as a real choice, because she was a genocidal maniac and he didn't seem to actually like her very much anyway. And then he never had a choice to be king or not after that anyway, his choices were just made for him. His personality was irrelevant to how his story ended.
I was okay with the hound's ending
Oh my god yes. I was in the Jaime is legit returning because he can't shake his addiction camp. I spent that whole week just lurking and refusing to engage with people who thought I was dumb as rocks for thinking that. I stand by my original quote:\n\n> I get that most people are reading it this way, but it seriously felt like a setback in his character arc watching how it played out last night. Hopefully it turns out better than it felt out of the gate.
I\u2019d say Theon has a pretty good ending from a character development point of view.\n\nAfter all the shit he\u2019s done (attacking Winterfell, \u201ckilling\u201d Bran and Rickon), all the shit he\u2019s had to suffer (Ramsay and Euron), I really enjoyed that his final scenes involved defending the same Stark he supposedly killed.\n\nHim randomly charging the Night King with a spear was pretty dumb, but aside from that I was completely on board with his ending.
Haha for me it is the opposite
The more I think about the trial scene the worse it becomes
I had that problem with episode 3. I just rather not think too much. Even when i was watching it. Just annoyed me so much.
If this was an anime, Arya would be the MC
Yup, very true. The crazy things she does in the show wouldn\u2019t change though because they\u2019re already very Anime-y
The Battle of Winterfell was straight outta DBZ. Jon Snow (Vegeta) is built up to defeat the main bad only for Arya (Goku) to swoop in and save the day.
[This parody comic got it right. This is my favorite fanart of GoT ever.](https://i.redd.it/lzjpbuowgzfz.jpg)
Agreed, I love book Arya, but I've **hated** TV Arya with pure loathing ever since she survived the fight against the waif. That was when she took a turn into a generic TV hero who always survives everything and away from realistic GRRM character.\n\nI mean seriously, the crap she pulled over the last 4 seasons is just insanely wrong, including:\n\n* Survived nearly being killed by the waif because it just so happens some random woman can heal deep sword wounds with just a night's rest and let Arya run around like normal the very next day. Even with today's medical technology it would take over a month for you to fully recover from such an injury, and you **definitely** would not be ready to run for your life and fight to the death the very next day.\n\n* Murdering multiple important members of house Frey and cooking them in a pie without **anyone** noticing something was amiss and sounding an alarm.\n\n* Murdering the Lord of house Frey without anyone noticing.\n\n* Murdering the entirety of House Frey and escaping without a single scratch.\n\n* Jumping in out of nowhere (as if from an Arya catapult) to land on and kill the Night King just in the nick of time, despite being far from the Night King a few minutes prior!\n\n* Cheating death at least a half dozen times as the city was being burnt down and destroyed, including surviving a fire blast from Drogon where they cut away from her a second before she clearly was going to be roasted alive.\n\nThis isn't a GRRM character, this is a TV super hero who can always beat hoards of bad guys no matter how long the odds. It's not what Game of Thrones is about.
I loved Arya's character for the first 4 seasons, my favorite along with Tyrion, and even for most of seasons 5-6.\n\nAfter that, she became some superhero ninja vigilante.  They would show good scenes where she shows signs of her humanity, which I liked, but then they would have her go back to smug robotic ninja again.
Agree 100%. The took the 'badass kid' trope and pushed it so far that she became not just uninteresting but unlikable. Plus the stupid smug look she had on her face for 99% didn't help.
>Even with today\u2019s medical technology it would take over a month for you to recover from such an injury\n\nEven with today\u2019s medical technology those wounds would very likely have been fatal. The Waif literally turned Arya\u2019s intestines into fettuccine bolognese. She could\u2019ve bled out in minutes if a large artery such as the common iliac or inferior mesenteric were lacerated. And between the feces seeping from her bowel perforations and the rank harbor water, Arya had a one way ticket to fulminant peritonitis and septic shock. She would\u2019ve needed emergency surgery (repair any lacerated blood vessels, bowel resection, and washout), big gun IV antibiotics, and a blood transfusion to make it.\n\nEDIT: Grammar
Should have been that Arya got killed by the waif and the waif took her face.
You forgot the worst which is her personality, it has become smug and arrogant treating murder like children's play.
The healing thing was dumb I will give you that...  \n\n\nBut the rest makes sense in her character.  She was meant to be an assasain so quiet and sneaky, even her blood drops are louder than her footsteps.  She escaped without a scratch because simply, she killed the entire house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the catapult, she presumably jumped from a top the wall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso she was not shown for like a half hour before she showed up then.  Jon was fighting the dragon in the courtyard right next to where Bran was.  It makes sense she showed up.  After she talked to the Red Woman, she started to travel over to Bran in order to save him.  The timing was convenient yes, but everyone was fixated on the night king at the time.  Nobody heard her coming and she was incredibly sneaky.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever she did have plot armor from the unbelievable amount of injuries she sustained during her fights.
I surprised that these gaps in logic - purely the fault of the writers - can make you hate the character. Her personality traits still developed in a really interesting and compelling way and that's the core of it. (If you disagree then fair enough, but that's a much better reason than \"she has too much plot armour\".)
Arya is one of those characters that was written to be loved in the very beginning and that has basically been carried all these years and even after she became fucking weird. Book Arya is still alright, but show Arya is the single worst character on this show.
Her character has been terribly written since S6 at least and then it got worse once she returned to Westeros and became this edgy obnoxious & ridiculously OP killer with a constant smug face
I'm not really shocked. And the question was choose your favourite Stark, not necessarily the best character in the whole series. Even though her character became very one-note and strange after season 4, the thing is the other 3 living Starks are not really doing much to overtake her as favourite Stark. And she really benefitted from killing the Night King this season.\n\nBran was never going to have a lot of fans. I'm very surprised Jon was not everyone's favourite Stark, but this season was not very good for him. People mostly love what his character represents: a bastard who's actually a prince, the person who was willing to bring everyone together. But personality-wise, sometimes he's lacking in that area because of his quiet and brooding nature, but people remember the spunky rebellious Arya.\n\nSansa is interesting because her fans have really increased over the last 4 seasons, but unfortunately her character was one of the most hated in the beginning. And the people who tend to love Arya won't easily interchange her with Sansa. It also didn't help that this season she was being compared to Littlefinger and Cersei.
So.. what are the problems with her? Besides surviving stuff she shouldn\u2019t survive, what are the problems with how she acts?
To me, her motivations are completely inconsistent. She gives up her assassin training because being a Stark is too important to her, good. She gives up her trip south to kill Cersei when she hears that the Starks took back Winterfell, good. She tells Jon how family is important yada yada. But then after the NK dies, she immediately bails on her family again on what she says is a one-way trip to kill Cersei. Wtf? Didn't we already get over this? Why did she regress by two seasons suddenly with no explanation?\n\nIt's even crazier because she has the power to end the war single-handedly, and just doesn't tell anyone. Like Sansa in the BoB, she lets Jon  lead a battle to his probable death when she knows she could prevent it, if she just told him ahead of time. This makes absolutely no sense as a character decision.\n\nThen she decides not to kill Cersei and to live instead, which is good in theory, except I no longer even know what her deal is or what's driving her decisions. Presumably she wants to survive and be with her family? But then after Bran becomes king, she bails on her family again! What the hell, Arya? What are you even doing? What does this character value, what does she want? She harps on about family but clearly doesn't give a shit about them. She comes off as hypocritical and basically crazy.
she's perfectly normal and well adjusted.  she should be a traumatized, ptsd ridden mess, a sadistic mass murderer hell bent on revenge with little humanity left.
I liked Arya a lot up until Season 5. She *was* my favorite character. But then they 1) shipped her off to Braavos for almost 2 seasons and separated her from every other character, 2) had her survive getting stabbed in the belly and getting sewage poo in her tummy because why not, 3) had her come back to Westeros, murder people and cook them into a pie totally casually, 4) had her kill the Freys and escape with absolutely no consequences and no effect on the narrative whatsoever, 5) had her kill the Night King because they needed it to happen I guess and there wasn't enough time to make it satisfying in any way or involve characters who actually had any storyline connected to him in any way, 6) made her mostly useless in Seasons 7/8 except for the Night King bit and 7) most importantly *sent her off to Braavos in the first place despite none of that really ever paying off.*\n\nI always told myself Arya had invincible plot armor because they sent her to Braavos and there was no way they would do that without bringing her back to make use of what she learned and have an impact on the main story (even her death in Braavos wouldn't affect anybody because most people didn't know she was there or that she was even still alive).\n\nWell, it turns out that was only half right - she did have plot armor, but they didn't seem to have any plans for her at all.\n\nAdmittedly Arya did some despicable stuff before Season 5 too but it was always interesting. For example, when she kills that stable boy in Season 1.
I had loved her character when the show began but started hating it afterwards (season 5 onwards).
Yeah that\u2019s easily the worst scene in GoT history only challenged by the Jaime/Bronn Dorne scenes. The difference is those scenes were forgettable and relatively unimportant. This scene is arguably the MOST important in the show and it\u2019s ALSO so poorly done
Why did the Unsullied let Jon and Tyrion live so long after Dany dies? It's been weeks and they were killing no-name Lannister soldiers for fun earlier. The guy who betrayed their queen and the guy who killed her get to live? Then they allow Tyrion to decide the king and Jon to go into exile, then up and leave. Additionally, the Dothraki seemingly merge with Westeros and live in King's Landing now (They weren't leaving on those ships) when they should be killing Jon then committing suicide as blood riders do.\n\nThe king decision scene was a huge load of BS. Arya threatens Yara with no effect, Sansa insults her uncle (an ally) for no reason which potentially cripple future relations and alliances, Tyrion picks Bran of all people because \"stories are important\" even though he seemingly doesn't mean all the stories Bran can tell but the story of Bran himself (which is a boring story at best), Bran basically announces he knew he'd be King which begs the question 'Did he allow this genocide and fallout?\", and then everyone unanimously agrees this creep they never met should be king based on the words of a traitor.\n\nPlus all the comedy they threw in in the moments after one of the most influential characters died. Plus the terrible small council scene that actually made no sense. How was Tyrion excluded from the history book? He was hand to 2 leaders, killed a hand, and is blamed for killing a king. Sam shouldn't be Grand Maester since he only got 1 or 2 links and didn't spend the years and years necessary at the citadel, it would make more sense for Brienne to be Sansa's Queensguard, and like you said Bronn being Master of Coin makes no sense. Tyrion should have had Bronn executed.\n\nI could probably go on but it's pointless, the shitshow is done and I'm exhausted.
To add on to what the other poster replied with...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJon's heritage wasn't even brought up in the final episode. Ultimately it just became a plot device for Daenerys even though it's a revelation that has world-changing consequences. Varys was even writing letters in Episode 5 and we only saw him burning the last letter he was writing... so unless we're going to fill in the plot whole for the writers the viewer is left to believe the rest of the letters were sent out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am overall pretty disappointed that Jon never got any conflict or development over his true parentage outside of his relationship with Daenerys, but at least that isn't a gaping plot hole like it's complete irrelevance in 8.06.
Watch pretty much ANY review of the episode on YouTube for the answer to your question.
Arya has done some seriously fucked up shit.  \n  \nMurdered a child whose only crime was pushing her \n  \nThreatened and showed off about murdering that child to another child  \n  \nViolently tortured and murdered many, many people  \n  \nMurdered and then hacked up the dead bodies of 2 men to then bake into a pie Hannibal Lector-style to serve to their father    \n  \nSlit the throats of prominent political figures  \n  \nMass poisoned an entire house\n  \nAnd worst of all, killed the saviour of the world, the one true king that could actually bring real peace to the land: the Night King. And in so doing, literally genocided an entire race from the world.  \n  \nArya makes Dany look like a Saint.  \n  \nAnd that little shit got to make a little judgey face about \"I know a killer when I see one\" and got to go Captain Jack Sparrow into the west...  \n  \nI hope a Kraken eats her
All of what you mentioned except for the genocide of the dead, are why I hated how people keep saying look at Dany's past and you can see she was gonna be the mad queen. Most of the characters in this show have done and threatened to do some fucked up shit
I fucking hate Arya stans
It would work better if her story is presented as a tragedy like it is in the books.
Casually threatens Yara to cut her throat too. This little shit got no respect since she has become the most overpowered character in the show.
I know that she was brutal and messed up, but she was also complex and compelling and that's why I loved the character. I never judge TV characters on how much I want to be their friend.
What child did she murder?
As opposed to the super-psychic  who has zero interest in ruling, knows nothing about leading anyone or running a kingdom, has zero social skills, and is so troubled he murdered an entire city and spent 2 seasons so emotionally crippled that he is unable to want at all.
Well I never said I like show Bran being on the throne either.
Honestly that is what I have hated lately.  Even the last 3, 4 seasons.  It is really cool to watch, but that isn't why I loved this show.  I remember back in season 1-4 they didnt even show the fight scenes.  They would just skip through and show the aftermath of it all with a few dead people on the ground.  Aside from a few 1 on 1 battles (Or something of the sorts) they did not show any fighting at all.    \n\n\nIt has turned into too much of a fighting/battle tv show and strayed from their roots of simply good character arcs, conflicts, politics and drama.
>fighting/battle tv show\n\nWhat the fuck fighting did you see? There was only Cleganebowl. It turned into more of a dumb shit happens and Tyrion says dumb shit type of TV show. If it was all battles it would've been much better.
That's pretty much my dad, never even watched season 1 and just watched the show because its popular. Unfortunately that's who it seems these last 2 seasons were catered too.
Who watches a show like this without starting from the beginning? Gross.
I don't think that's a fair summary in this case. A lot of the rage actually comes from these very people, many of whom were Dany stans who fully expected her to sit on the Throne and bring peace and prosperty to the galaxy, and issues of pacing aside could never imagine her doing anything bad.
The gatekeeping in this thread is fucking insipid hahaha
Book reader here, I'd rate the season a 9/10. Character arcs make sense to me, spectacle was amazing. Could've done with a couple more episodes but that doesn't make what was there less than a 9 IMO.
I really don't understand this. Only episode 5 was full of any spectacle at all. What are casual fans enjoying about this at all? Probably more than half the season is just Tyrion talking random nonsense that is supposed to sound smart. I feel like they did a fucking poor job of appealing to casual fans too, but they still liked it for some reason. They walked the line of like trying to be a smart well written show and being a casual fanservicey action packed romp and it woulda been better to just go full on in that direction instead of pretending to be something else.
Episode 3 had spectacle.
I don't even agree that the spectacle was great this season. Battle in episode 3 was too chaoti c. And dark to even see what was going on. The NK's death was about as lame as could be. I had no idea what was happening with the dragon fight in that episode. The epic fights this season were anything but epic. Compare cleganebowl to the hound vs. Brienne fight. The sacking of Kings Landing was basically just Dany flying around burning things. Compare that to the scene when she takes out the ships at slavers bay. Even the spectacle fell short this episode, partly, I think, because emotional investment in the characters was severely lacking this season after they decided to completely 180 everyone.
I really apreciate it now even more, that I have really loved the finale, after reading all that stupid butthurt comments.\n  I am not your opinion. So what?\n  Guess what, I found it genius! \n   I'm happy and satisfied, and I dont know, but I prefer to be NOT your opinion.
Yup, I think I forget that not everyone is like me (surprising I know)\n\nI hate TV. Haven\u2019t watch a single series of TV in years before GoT, but this show was different. And that\u2019s what I loved.\n\nA huge portion of the fan base watches all the random garbage on TNT and CBS and FX and whatever so GoT is just another night they have plunked in front of the tube.\n\nAnd for those people it was great. Another piece of eye candy they could use to waste the time between work and sleep. All my friends on Facebook who liked the final season fit that description to a tee.
Whatever random CBS TNT FX shows you are thinking are simply better than this season, that's the crazy part. People will still say this season was better because it had well designed dragons and costumes and shit, but a fucking Big Bang Theory episode is way more logically and tonally consistent than this season.
Nope, I listen to a radio show daily that\u2019s decided they were going to talk about GoT while it was on. And they did a TERRIBLE job. Not knowing literally anyone\u2019s names except for Jon and \u201cDany\u201d\n\nAnd they were upset at all the people who didn\u2019t like the finale. They couldn\u2019t even mention Arya by name, just that she was the little assassin girl. Yet they thought the fandom was over reacting
Some people still seem to think Daenerys' name is Khaleesi.
i overheard someone on the bus say that people only dislike it because the show is ending and it made the most sense that 'wheelchair kid' would be leader. They also said dany was 100% alive and warged into her dragon
Ok but hang on that sounds really cool
Maybe a lot of them, but a guy on a forum I visit has been watching since S1 aired, and has read all the books, and he loved season 8. I'm baffled by it too, to be honest, but there we go. There are legitimate fans who weren't disappointed and we probably shouldn't be snobby and dismissive of everyone.
\"if you liked the show you're a casual\"\n\nimagine being this insufferable
They really are casual thou. Not that there's anything wrong with liking things casually but don't complain when people have valid criticism. Like how can anyone be okay with the ironborn and Dorneish just accepting a new king while the north goes free? The same ironborn who rebelled just 7 years ago for their own independence is now blindly loyal to a dead queen who they only fought for because she promised them independence aren't seizing this chance to be free? Or the Dorneish who have defyed Targaryen rule for 200 years just go along with a new king? Stuff like this is happening constantly on the show these past seasons and I can't see how anyone truely immersed in the story wouldn't be tired of having to constantly ignore what the characters were saying to enjoy the show, especially when this show was initially built off the wonderful characters and not constant Micheal bay action scenes.
/r/gatekeeping ?
If the only requirement to get through that gate is naming 5 main characters, after 8 seasons, that's a gate im willing to keep till I die
There's definitely a certain group this season aimed to please, and dismissing those people as \"not true fans\" is stupid. Let people enjoy things.
No one is stopping anyone from enjoying anything.
No. I read all the books twice, watched the series 3 times, and as flawed as season 8 was, I still loved it. I still do, despite what's happening in this thread.\n\nI've been kind of depressed all week though, had some deaths in the family and coming on here compounds that. My GF and I both really liked a lot of the season, the knighting of Brienne, Dany turning into her father, Jon ultimately deciding to abandon his honor, his title, and love for what's right, Drogon destroying the throne. Tyrion throwing out the family monarchy in favor of a voting system was a great step towards democracy and what I always imagined Tyrion's character would offer the world. The coming together of all characters to fight a common battle, drinking together post-battle. Fitting, sad deaths of Theon, Jorah, Edd. The cinematography and music were beautiful, the acting fantastic. There were writing issues that have been talked about ad naseum here, but it wasn't enough to bring down the culmination of it all for me.\n\nSo yes, it's true, I loved it despite its flaws. No, it's not the best in the series. But it ended it well for me and I was massively entertained.\n\nBut like I said, people claiming that if I liked it I \"can't name more than five characters\"... this is just too much for me guys. I might have to stop reading here.
Idk, I could name every main character and 90-95% of every named character, and I thought the ending was alright.  I wouldn't say it's amazing, but the people who are calling it shit seem like the people who would have been mad at every single ending unless it was the one ending they wanted to happen.  And the people who are calling it disappointing probably held D&D to GRRM's standards, which was never going to happen.  Not even GRRM can finish his own books to his standards in ten years, and they expected D&D to do it in two?  There were things I wish were fleshed out more, but for the most part, I thought the end was explained well enough that I could fill in gaps/missing scenes and conversations.  And logically, the plot made sense and was built up well enough for me to accept.  I don't know why people are complaining that Dany going mad came out of nowhere.  She's been this way since the beginning and has always had advisors caution her, and push for mercy.  Without them, no one's there to advise mercy, and we get King's Landing.  On the death of the NK, I'm fine with Arya killing him too.  Yeah, it would have made complete sense for Jon to do it, but I know that if he did, people would have complained that it followed the fantasy trope.  Too many differenct fans, someone will always complain.  People just held season 8 to a higher standard and forgot about the shortcomings in prior episodes.  They've hyped the ending in their own heads for two years, so when they didn't get what they want, they complain on the internet.
Wat. \n\nYou think the rightful heir to the throne who killed a person who just torched an entire city of innocents should be sent to a wall for life to protect the kingdom from the guys they destroyed in episode 3? Meanwhile, they let a little guy who is on trial for treason basically make the most important decision the Kingdom will make for centuries? And then they pick a guy who hasn\u2019t said a fucking thing for a couple seasons. That same guy got a bunch of \u201caye\u2019s\u201d from house leaders who wouldn\u2019t even know who bran was, or much less why he\u2019s fit to be king. Bran says earlier that he can never be lord of anything, but now he\u2019s king. He also says he\u2019s come all this way to be king, so basically he knew Dany was going to killed a few hundred thousand innocents and just let it happen. \n\nYou\u2019re totally cool with Bran gaining all these powers and then just ghosting for the battle with the dead? And you\u2019re also fine with the White Walkers targeting Bran for some unknown reason even though he clearly doesn\u2019t do anything? You\u2019re cool with the White Walkers obviously having some intelligence and motive, but then their story is over before we even understand anything about them? Why were they targeting encyclopedia instead of the A10 Warthogs? \n\nYou\u2019re cool with Arya getting some crazy powers in order to make pies out of tertiary characters and then never use them again? \n\nThere\u2019s easily another season worth of story to wrap up/explain. You could easily make two seasons without it feel like it\u2019s dragging on.
They got weird ass names. I\u2019ve watched the show since the start and am doing my second re-watch and I still don\u2019t know half the characters names. (I\u2019m not one that thought the last two seasons were any good though) \n\u201cYo that\u2019s that bad dude that fucks with magic and green shit!\u201d \u201cYo that\u2019s that dude that sounds like he\u2019s coughing up phlegm when he says his name\u201d. \u201cYo, \u201ccool uncle\u201d shitty jack Sparrow is on!\u201d That\u2019s how I remember the characters.
Casual
You selfrighteos fucks\n\n   Jesus.
That is pretty much me. I don't look too hard at shows and just like it based on how it made me feel. I thought for the most part season 8 was really good, but even I had problems with the last episode.
Except if you don\u2019t care about those 2 things then what do you care about? Action? Because this episode had none. Characters? Because none of them made sense.\n\nThe only people who I could see genuinely enjoying that episode are fans of Bran or people who only watch the series because it\u2019s \u201ctrendy\u201d but have never actually seen an episode before season 6. And I doubt that makes up 10% of this subreddit.\n\nNo, I\u2019m almost completely positive the \u201cAmazing (9.9)\u201d people were only trying to skew the ratings system because they new that so many people were going to crush this episode.
Some people don\u2019t nitpick. As a book reader before the TV series was announced I understand that there are some holes and that not everyone is happy, but I\u2019m sure that I\u2019m not the only one who thought, \u201cwow that was really incredible to have been a part of all this and goddamn what an ending\u201d
They are.\n\nDoesn't mean I can't scratch my head, questioning as to how they came to that opinion.
If I said Scary Movie 5 was the greatest film ever made I\u2019d hope someone would show up and question my opinion. \n\nJust because something is subjective doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be head scratching
[deleted]
Doesn't mean some opinions aren't wrong.
Yeah, but is that reaction really that bad?\n\nIt'd be like 'oh whoa, you support the pro-life bill?' type of realization.
Comparing liking an episode of a TV show to supporting a bill that requires children to bear their rapist's babies. This is some peak /r/gameofthrones shit.
There's no way edmure joins sansa after that
There's a reason he sat down, and that's because he's already subservient to her. If he had to choose between joining his boss-niece Sansa or the people who kept him captive all this time, the Lannisters, of course he'd choose Sansa. Her being rude once is not enough to convince a kingdom to abandon their allies and join their enemies.
LOL it\u2019s a rolling commode!
I\u2019m sure he attempts to jerk off at times. Who knows it\u2019s just hard to take Bran serious
I guess I was in completely different sub full of fanart and cosplay like the off-season and \"unpopular opinion: I liked it\" x100 silver, x1000 gold, x10000 plat. \nAll the fun community left this sub a long time ago.
Have you been in a single episode thread? Post-episode thread? Survey thread? Any of the dozens of \u201cthis made no sense and here\u2019s why\u201d threads? \n\nSure this sub isn\u2019t as critical as r/asoiaf and turned on the writers later but this sub has been complaining non-stop since Episode 4 at least.
bruh what? this sub has been nothing but whinging and the few posts that do say \"I liked it\" get immediately shit on in the comments
This sub isn't r/asoiaf (which really all it does is complain) but it certainly has a lot of defenders. Until 8.06 the last few episodes have had at least two threads simply stating how they like the episode and it becomes a well-liked gilded thread (including one that asked for no negativity and just positive comments):\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bnxnib/spoilers\\_unpopular\\_opinion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bnxnib/spoilers_unpopular_opinion/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is one of the more recent ones I can easily find (I am not investing time to hunt down the rest). I've even seen genuine complaints get constantly written off as haters, people who aren't paying attention, people who should not watch the show anymore, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis sub certainly has gotten negative, but it's not as if there aren't a lot of positive posts either. If it was positive in past seasons and turned negative in this most recent one that is very telling of season 8.
Now *there's* a show that knows how to end right. They're so good at series finales, they made three!
Agreed. I\u2019m ok with all of the major plot points of season 8, just not the execution.
100% agree. I\u2019m just so happy for them they made it
Even as a Sansa fan I found literally all of the rest of it unsatisfying
If anything, it should be worse. My wife and I started the show 4 weeks ago with no spoilers. We clearly saw pacing and writing inconsistencies starting at around the end of season 6 whenever Arya gets stabbed like 4 times and survives and heals in a night. From then on, plot armor and shitty pacing was very obvious since the previous seasons were literally only days apart to us watching.
Yep. This isn't just book readers nitpicking about their favorite theories not coming to fruition. It was a fundamental failure of storytelling. My mother, my sister, and the guys at the barber shop I go to are all show-only people, and they were all bitterly disappointed, and could clearly articulate the problems with the past two seasons' narratives, character issues, and logic.
watching the dorne plot was very jarring.  everything was just completely off.  characters were no longer coherent, and the plot was just...
> My wife and I started the show 4 weeks ago with no spoilers. \n\nMajor props to your epic binge.
I'm a big stan of Sansa and still found this season disappointing, and episode 6 was extremely underwhelming and frustrating for me.
I just lowered my expectations after season 6 and a bit more after season 7. So it was difficult to be disappointed. Also a bit of a Sansa fan.
The show has been up and down for a few seasons now in my opinion. I liked some episodes this season and disliked some others. I thought that the ending felt rushed and a bit confusing, but at the same time I also don't think that any possible ending would have been good enough for me. So I'm a bit forgiving.\n\nAlso, I loved the Long Night. I'm probably a minority in that.
That sub is where you go when you want to ignore the problems this season had, those people legit think this season was absolutely amazing and there is no constructive discussions where they point out issues and if you attempt to voice your opinion that the writing is bad - they say you are just a sheep. Ironically, they have a sheep mentality that this season was actually good - stray to far from the herd and you get hated on.
I've seen the most meaningful discussions (and criticisms) of S8 so far down in the comments on that sub. Unlike others which are just a hate wagon.
I'm not really making any conclusions. I just think it is interesting. I personally saw some leaks by accident and I think it affected the experience. The leaks I saw out of context were really dumb, and when it actually happened it was a bit frustrating.
Yea I meant to reply to the guy that replied to you. Sorry.
> the things the Hound told her before he fought the Mountain were exactly what most people were thinking\n\nBut did those even make sense? He was trying to tell her that she has to be careful and shouldn't let vengeance consume her, but she already murdered a family and baked them into pies to feed to their father out of revenge. \n\nLike, vengeance already has her, and for one person saying \"nah but what if you didnt?\" to just change her entire life made no sense.
I liked the opening sequence and the credits after D&Ds name went away
When the best parts of Game of Thrones are the ones without dialogue, something went wrong
> I disagree with the concept that a popular character should prevail at the end of the story. It's exactly the opposite of what GRRM's story is based upon.\n\nCharacters are usually popular because they are interesting though. What has happened here is a boring character which the audience is not particularly invested in has been put on the throne instead of one anyone enjoys watching. An interesting character getting the throne would have been much better, whether that is a character who is good or bad or likely or unlikely to sit the throne.
You are using different words to say the same thing: you'd much rather have someone that the public loves be the final winner.\n\nThis is not how the story works, it has been established since Season 1 and it's one of the main reasons it's such a good story
Bronn's whole story this season was such a giant mess.
Yeah I think they absolutely wasted him
are you Dan or Dan? You just keep defending this pile of horseshit all over the place...
I didn't like many things about this season. This doesn't mean the story is a pile of horseshit.
Yeah, I get people having issues with the execution of the finale. I agree with that. It felt really rushed and they should probably have done another season if they wanted to wrap things up the way they did. This show used to be slow paced and intriguing, not an action novel.\n\nSo I get that complaint. What I don't get is how a lot of complaints boil down to \"things didn't go the way I wanted to\", which sort of has been the trademark of the show from the start. I have to admit that I do think that Bran isn't the most interesting character, but I also think that he mostly just suffered from the rushed execution and the fact that his story arc has been a bit of an irrelevant mess until the last few episodes.\n\nThey tried to make him a bit more interesting and relevant these last few episodes, but it was wasted effort because he simply had been so irrelevant to the main storyline for so long and a few episodes of screentime isn't going to change that. So again, the story really could have worked well if they would have taken their time with it.
Sure that played a part, but if you deny that Tyrion saying those words him were very helpful in convincing Jon, then you weren't paying attention. And regardless, it was still a great callback to S1.
It really went from bad to worse didn't it.\n\nSeason 7 writing \n\n1. Stupid idea to go on wight hunt and lose a dragon to the night king\n2. Loads of pregnancy related breadcrumbs for all of them to be entirely pointless at the end\n3. Littlefinger plot and the whole fake Arya and Sansa bickerings\n4. Bran returned only to become a zombie tree man with no sharing of any of the information - what good was it for him to have all that free internet bandwidth with no use to anyone. It is still literally unbelievable that NK came only for Bran\n\nSeason 8 - well there are probably 10-12 things wrong which I am not going to list and all of them are worse than the season 7 ones
The Arya and Sansa bickerings weren't fake.
Yeah, which is why I'm okay with it. I think that whatever ending the show would have had, it wouldn't have been satisfying. Except maybe an open ending. I can't think of any big show ending that was celebrated, except for Breaking Bad.\n\nIt's a bit dissappointing that they rushed it so bad that it became confusing. I think that to wrap it up like they did, they had to spend way more time developing the story arcs rather than changing characters seemingly at will. Still, it's been one of the best shows I've ever watched and a lesser ending isn't going to change that.
They are not trolling. The ppl that gave this episode a 10, just gave every other episode a 10. Consistency and some questionable intelligence.
So, they turned the wheel on its side? Now instead of a wheel that crushes the peasants under its rim as great houses fight to be on top, now it is a merry-go-round that is driven by political machinations? A pretty courtly political dance far above the heads of the common folk?\n\nBecause I could buy that if they didn't skip over all the political dealings and ramifications.
It\u2019s an improvement from before, Rome wasn\u2019t built in one day. If they installed a democracy I would have shut off the tv before the episode ended. This takes place in medieval times. Democracy didn\u2019t come about until hundred of years later.. it\u2019s a process
They still do. \n\nA Stark is in charge with a Lannister and a Tarly serving on his council. The Greyjoys, Martell, Arryn and Baratheon families are all still in charge of their respective territory. On top of that, the Stark family is also in charge of their own independent kingdom. \n\nAll of these families will give their titles down through their families and no other way. Exception of this is the actual throne since Bran can't have an heir, so yeah, bloodshed awaiting.\n\nDon't give me the whole \"they did it for the realm\", Sam proposed an elective monarchy and it became clear that they laughed at the idea of letting go of their positions of power. They propped up one of theirs (member of a rich and powerful family) to assure the benefit of their own interests.
A big bad an episode, till no one is left but Tormund and Ghost, because they could never be big bads.
He was amazing in bodyguard

Thank you for this comment, really brought up my mood.
Damn Arya ruined pies for me, now thats the first thing I think about whenever someone mentions pies.
also possibly true, agreed
Maybe I sounded that way which was not my intention. I just wanted to point out that 1 is too unfair. Anyways, I agree with your main argument I should not generalize or try to guess people's reasoning. I am a bit sad about all the people involved and their effort.
if you got an average person and made them use more than about 40% of their attention to watch this series all the way through, you have to be borderline challenged to rate it a 7 or above. either that or you are a delusional peter pan child who thinks everything is wonderful and negativity is bad.
\"So Dorne and The Iron Islands don't want to secede despite Dorne being really high-up in authority, and Yara literally only joining Daenerys under the concession of independence?\"\n\n\"Huh, Arya killing Green Eyes didn't pan out huh?\" \n\n\"Bran Stark, the guy who didn't want to be Lord of Winterfell, hasn't had his powers explained and hasn't warged into anything or done anything of importance is now King and done nothing to earn it outside of being 'magical bait', which isn't even all his doing (NK marked him)? The guy who literally got carried everywhere cause of his bum legs?'\n\n\"Why does Tyrion get to talk and tell them choose a leader if he's a prisoner?\"\n\n\"So Jon's Targaryen ancestry boils down to riding Rhaegal in one battle, and fucking up his relationship with Daenerys? Not even a contender for the throne with no one battling to save him? Like he was stripped of his titles. He didn't even come up for nomination.\"\n\n\"Why did Drogon burn the throne and carry of Daenerys body?\"\n\n\"How did Bronn become Lord of Highgarden. How does a common cut-throat become leader over countless other houses when he doesn't know how to read or write.\"\n\n\"Why is there a Night's Watch, or was that a farce. Are Yara and Dorne angry and going to upkeep a watch on Jon, or is he literally okay if Greyworm fucks off? What is this.\"\n\n\"Greyworm, you're going to the place with flesh-eatting butterflies.\"\n\n\"So expanding on this; Tyrion basically fucks up everything for Daenerys, and then gets her killed and is now Hand of the King again? What a punishment. /s.  This is the guy who after realizing Varys was right commented how Varys was going to tell him 'I told you so', over 'Wow I killed my best friend over nothing.' How did Tyrion become fucking judge, jury, and executioner at his own trial.\"\n\n\"So I get the whole system change, which will still probably lead to fighting cause system changes do that, but Daenerys infertility was an issue, and Bran's is a virtue. Kinda an odd feeling juxtaposition. Nitpick here though.\"\n\n\"Arya trained with faceless assassins and only used her magical face skills ONE TIME in Westeros.  Not to kill Cersei, not against the Night King, not against Daenerys, not against Sansa or Littlefinger. Against Walder Frey and his house. Wow.\"\n\n\"Writing is a magical thing that can make anything work and be powerful. But tell me, do people believe in Jon and Daenery's romance?  Now let's say Jon tried to kill Daenerys but got detained by guards that Daenerys is missing in her scene for some reason. What if Jorah Mormont had lived and Daenerys had gone crazy? How would it have felt if Jorah had killed her instead? Died to dragonfire after?  That would've been fucking heartbreaking. And it would've totally killed the dumb [lover must kill lover] trope. Could even have Jon drop Longclaw. Jon and Daenery didn't have chemistry or the time to make it happen. Jorah and Daenerys did, eight seasons worth.\"
> you have to be borderline challenged to rate it a 7 or above\n\nBro, you had a chance to clarify it was an exaggeration, yet here you are doubling down and literally calling people borderline mentally challenged for liking this season.\n\nI'm going to assume there's not a single show or film that you like or think is good, otherwise I get to call you mentally challenged. See how this works?
mate it has 4 upvotes and every single reply is hating on it.
got technically worse by number... see any score for rt, imdb..lol
I mean he disappeared off into the wilderness where he will definitely be chopping trees down at some point. Too close to being a lumberjack for comfort.
Well, you feed people to dogs for fun so I don't know if I trust your opinion.
At least we dont practice incest
Right, but Dany's followers might have been cool with it if they found out Jon's true identity??? Guess we will never know...
you want a pat on the back for hating it? seems like most people on the sub do.
[deleted]
If you hated It so much why are you wasting your time discussing It on the internet with strangers. You didn\u2019t hate It, It just didn\u2019t meet the same standard of quality as seasons 1-5. \n\nI think everyone is confusing hate for the last season with disappointment.
It's true even if they downvote
Better than expected? Yes\n\nGood? Definitely not
Yeah i've been defending this show all season but the finale was indefensible imo i think they tried to curveball everyone but went too far
I do kinda see his point, and I've never even tried cocaine.
So you're saying more people really liked it than hated it? ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)
Ok but that is cherry picking to fit your narrative. Why did you not choose 1-2 and 9-10? Because it doesn't fit your narrative.
I ran the descriptive statistics on the data set and the distribution is negatively skewed. So that's not cherry picked data, and it does end up fitting my narrative. Happy?
That is not how numbers work. There are more 1s than 10s. Remove extremes and you get a 5.9. I'm not here arguing it was good, just the hypocrisy going around here.
... Read those sections
Oh, yeah. Definitely rushed.\n\nThe fact that the very things that drew me into the show (Whitewalkers) were decimated in a single episode was upsetting.
Fckin Bron. His plot was stupid and lazy as shit. Like Brienne and Tormund they just kept him around for fan service at the end. I hated it. \n\nCan't wait for Greyworm to die from the butterfly disease in Naarth.
Some of the conversations were very private, it's not like Littlefinger bugged the place
Thats just poor writing.
Well the Night's Watch doesn't actually exist anymore so I guess he's got nothing else to do. \nI mean there's a huge hole in the Wall and Jon literally told the Wildlings they're welcome to come thru anytime (not to mention there's only about a hundred of them left so)
I could believe that Drogon just turned his head and the throne was in the way. He didn't burn Jon because he smelt of Targyreon, the throne was the next thing in his sight. An accidental irony. There's so much stupid stuff much worse that I'm going to let them get away with this one.
I could maybe buy that but he charges up and hits it again to really smother it which makes that reading way too generous
Nothing bothers people on this sub. They probably don't see any problem in the *council* scene.

Yeah, this sub. What a bunch of mindless plebs who have no understanding of cinematic elements? \n\nI thumb my nose at these people.\n\n/s
Ah. Thanks.
Exactly. People dont know we had the finale spoilers for months. Except nobody believed them because it sounded terrible. We thought there was no way D&D would air such garbage on HBO
And having this idea out there will affect perception. As you realize the leaks are true you are thinking about that and your preformed judgment instead of just taking it in for the first time.
because it was
Does that mean you didn\u2019t like a single thing about this episode?
It was the first episode that I wanted to finish as fast as possible because I started to get bored and stop caring. Eventhough, I liked the first 20-30 minutes, the directing and ridiculous situations the characters got themselves in (Tyrion literally being able to exacavate his brother and sister...) just took me out of the episode. Also, the second part was HORRIBLE it felt like a comedy!
Episode was boring and no I didn\u2019t like a single thing about it
A Single thing wouldn\u2019t even grant a 1/10. a ninety minute episode that\u2019s close to perfect is a nine, but if I honestly enjoyed just about five minutes and thought the dragon looks cool that\u2019s not a five, is it? I think I rated it about 4 or 5, but after a couple of days i feel worse about it.
Well that\u2019s idiotic
I actually though episode 6 made episode 5 way better because it made Dany\u2019s \u201cmad\u201d moment a little more understandable, but that\u2019s just me I guess.
Awesome how her victory lasted 20 minutes at most right
[deleted]
I hated this season but good god you're like all the worst parts of the internet in a single person.
That's what is mind blowing.  Even fan fiction is so much better than what we got.
r/asoiafcirclejerk
Im serious
Jon became pretty great, until this season when he was basically a lackey.
Yeah I agree. Jon became obsessed with honor and brooding, Arya obsessed with being a bad ass, and Sansa with power.
Not like there\u2019s many excellent arguments on this sub anyways
Sleepy? \n\n  I dont even know what to respond to that.\n\n  No?\n  I mean sure scenes were clearly stretched, particularly the one in the throne room. But sleepy?
I dont care, at least I am happy GoT fanboy, and you are bitter
Aren't they the producers and writers of the show since day one, since eleven years?
You know there is a saga of books called *A song of ice and fire* right?
Yeah.. I\u2019m down with the ending. But like if your going to put a monotoned 17 year old, that displays absolutely no emotion, creeps out everyone he comes into contact with, in the highest seat of power, you gotta leave some breadcrumbs for the people. You. Just. Gotta. \n\nDany went mad fine. We could have gotta over that one. Bran the one true king? No, that\u2019s not gunna fly, we need answers.
I don't understand how people could dismiss the teleportation during the entire journey beyond the wall.\n\nApparently all this can happen within a day: Gendry can run back to the wall (since when are blacksmiths good runners?), send a raven, said raven flied to Dragonstone and Daenerys managed to fly north and also find them. All within a day (or less or more, we honestly don't know as time basically doesn't exist in the show anymore).
I used to defend it thinking they had to get all their pieces in place to set up for season 8.  Turns out they rushed season 7 so they could rush season 8 and finish be done with it once and for all.
Have you seen the score on Rotten Tomatoes as well? Ouch!
I fucking hate what they did with Bran. He has explicitly stated that he cannot be Lord of Winterfell because he is the Three Eyed Raven now. He even said he\u2019s not even really a man. He made a bid deal about telling Jon his true heritage. Now all the sudden he wants to be King? He probably knew exactly what was going to happen with Danaerys and he said nothing. Fuck Bran and fuck these terrible writers.
If he had known, I wouldn\u2019t even be pissed. I mean if they spent the season showing bits that didn\u2019t make sense and left you questioning what bran was doing for it all to be revealed at the end. That may have possibly been good. But he was basically useless these past 2 seasons.
> He probably knew exactly what was going to happen with Danaerys and he said nothing. Fuck Bran and fuck these terrible writers.\n\nI think that's implied pretty heavily with the dragon vision over King's Landing back season 6 or whatever it was. But yeah that almost means that Bran/3ER was the ultimate villain in the end. They let everything happen or even nudged small things to make it happen just so the 3ER could become king. Really not sure if i'm a big fan of that
They completely fucked up so many characters. Bran, Danerys, Euron (was a great character that they wasted) Cersei, Arya. The only person that D+D actually gave a good story arch is Theon.\nThey should have done a lot more with Bran, and Euron honestly.
He lied. And, he's not Bran.  They all got outmaneuvered by Bloodraven
Literally said he didn't want to be king to Tyrion as it happened.
Isn't Bran on the throne presumably how GRRM told them it would end though?
To be fair, had he said something, someone would have tried to kill her meaning Cersei would have won, or should the killing be unsuccessful Dany would have done it anyways.
A very strange piece of writing, imo. Could nearly end up with Bran being viewed as a sort of Machiavellian figure, which I'm not sure was the writers' intention, but just illustrates how poorly executed the whole thing was..
I viewed the whole thing differently. He didn't want to be king, but since he's the three eyed raven he already knew that he would become king, so he did it to fulfill his destinay. Why was he chosen? Well that's sort of a paradox
I'd be interested to see a one off feature length episode showing what Westeros looks like in 100 years. With Bran being so passive and allowing so many disasters to happen, it would be interesting to see what he's like as a king. It would probably be like a HP Lovectaft story - eldritch being tricks everyone into making him king and goes on to turn his kingdom into a dystopian nightmare.
Where was the objection on religious grounds? Ebrose was writing a book but he wasn't at a grand council? Jim Broadbent didn't want to come back for one scene?\n\nHow can the septons have a different religion than the king without massive dissonance?
He doesn't want to be a king, but it was his responsibility to become one.\nBrans journey was to become a king which will lead Westeros to prosperity. He can see all previous king choices and consequences. He can see what happens in the world. And if he manages to grow weirwood, then he will be able to live long enough to give away his title for democracy.
Bran will be king in the books too.
Fucking writers!
Bran is very likely going to be king in the Books too. You calling GRRM terrible too?
Poorly written
That really grinds my gears. Literally 4 episodes before that he was talking about how he doesn\u2019t want to be Lord of anything. I feel like that was intentional misdirect by the writers, who again went for shock value versus logic
Plot twist. Bran/The Three eyed Raven learns to warg into Drogon and now that he has control of The Prince That Was Promised/The Stallion Who Mounts the World, cleanses the world by setting it afire, in the name of the Lord of Light. The Night King never wanted to end humanity. He wanted to stop the Three Eyed Raven from going on a rampage. People kept getting in the way, damnit!\n\nSEASON 9 CONFIRMED! GET HYPE!
Fantastic. You\u2019re hired
*\"One side's villain is the other side's hero.\"*
I still think they meant it as an upbeat line from him. I bet they just wanted to convey that he came all the way from kings landing, but the implication to the audience is that his whole journey and everything the realms went through was to get him on the throne.\n\nAnother victim of writing. Unless they intended it to make people think. Which could be the case, but than I'd argue they fumbled that. Cause it just warrants a \"H\u00e9? What the fuck?\"
I dunno, to me the line \"Why do you think I came all this way?\" implies prior knowledge. And he shouldn't be joking anymore anyways because he doesn't feel and isn't Bran anymore. Or is he? We will never know, because it flips and flops back and forth.
They clearly didn\u2019t realize how it sounded/looked in context\n\nNo surprise cause they suck
He said is like a sitcom joke. And then everyone chuckled, like, \"oh, Bran.\" The show acted like it was a funny aside, and didn't seem to understand the chilling implications of this statement.
It doesn\u2019t really matter either way tho, the implication is still the same that he knew he was going to be chosen.
As I said countless times since this \"sh\\*t\" happened, Bran was either the true villain of the story or a f\\*cking nobody that shouldn't get the throne/didn't deserve the throne (because of horrible character arc and lack of any personal connection to the throne).
>  bet they just wanted to convey that he came all the way from kings landing\n\nI really don't think this was what they were going for. It sounded like a *Everthing I did since season 6 was for this*
I heard that line and thought what you thought they intended, not the entire path of everything he's done.
You make great points about Bran, but everything you\u2019ve said is all examples that Brandon Stark did die when he became the 3ER.  We\u2019re still left trying to understand what the 3ER wanted exactly,  but it\u2019s safe to say he was after the Throne. He can see all possible futures and what better way to possibly end up on the Throne than through a Stark.  Is he a villain that just wants control or did the 3ER want to end tyranny as well? I do wish the story could have filled in the missing pieces,  but I think the first step in understanding it is that Bran is not sitting on the Throne it is the 3ER.
Yeah one of my biggest issues was not giving a single fuck about White Walker/CotF/3ER lore in the final two seasons
At least in the books, Bran is turning into a monster.  Jon, who has powers in the books, gets a lesson that basically amounts to a lesson in how to not be an evil wizard.  Bran is checking every box.  What he does to Hodor is an abomination in the books and pretty explicitly meant to be magical rape.  Bran knows it is wrong but does it constantly because it makes him feel good.  There are also worrying signs that he may be about to use Hodor to rape Meera.  He has also eaten human flesh both with his own hands and through his wolf.  Incidentally, Arya also murdered and ate a shepperd while dreaming in her wolf.
End tyranny after possibly manipulating Dany into killing everyone and giving access to the NK? LUL better luck next King :P In my opinion, he is the true villain of the story. Him and Dumb&Dumber. *So many plot holes :'(*
Why would Tyrion even back him!
I think we are absolutely led to believe that Bran's \"I don't want\" is sincere and that Varys (?) saying the best king is one who doesn't want it is a correct assessment. The end of the series is showing us the dawn of a new era and I think we are meant to believe in and embrace it. The king is innocent and all-knowing, the council is (with the exception of Bronn) made of people who only want the best for everyone, and the hereditary line of kingship is gone (which is what caused all this trouble in the first place.) I think theorizing that the 3ER was somehow a villain seizing control for nefarious purposes can be interesting but ultimately doesn't seem supported by anything and is not how we're supposed to interpret that ending. We can take this point at face-value.
I think Bran's arc never happened in the last seasons. He is not a mastermind strategist, he is someone who can see every moment happened in the past. Bran arc stopped with \"Hold the Door\" becoming the three eyes raven, a no human who has no interest in the humanity politics and only to preserve the world, nature and the order of things. Then, in episode 6 season 8 that status jumped directly to mastermind strategist who was always playing the game of the throne. There has been no arc, no sense, the directors didn't make bran develop into that direction. Seems like they just picked the one who was less likely to become king to shock audience because GoT always shocked audience, they thoight they could recreate shock as for example the \"Red Wedding\" did. \n\nOr maybe it was their goal since the start but they still wrote it awfully and this happened because they needed to rush it. They had 2 years to shoot so much footage and they even ended to waste those years by not being able to put those scenes together. \n\nFantastic acting. Fantastic CGI. Beautiful scenes if picked one by one. But it was all rushed, there is no real timeline between scenes they are just glued together. Lots of fanservice and Disney-like forced things. The ending season that a well written show like GoT  didn't deserve
His character had the most potential, I honestly hate how rushed this season was.
It seemed that him and Sansa manipulated Jon to get rid of Daenerys, take the fall, and allow both of them to get into power. At least that's the way the show presented it. \n\nBran gets to be King. \n\nSansa gets to rule an independent North. \n\nJon gets to...go live in Alabama
Aka the bransa conspiracy.
Bran's whole character has been terribly handled. Turned into an emotionless robot in the last 2 seasons, zero build up towards him becoming King and no real role in the WW arc & explaining his powers.\n\nAnd then they expected people to be ok with him becoming King and giving him lines like that? WTF
While I agree that it was a mediocre arc, I don't understand where you're getting this \"he neglected to do anything because he wanted power\" thing. He's reacted to every situation the same; He's never made an attempt to influence results in any way and he always tells people that they were where they were supposed to be regardless of the \"good\" or \"evil\" aspects about it. This felt like the same thing to me. Of course he knows when bad things are going to happen, but he's never attempted to prevent or help with one of them before, I don't understand why people expected him to all of a sudden.
Yeah and we never heard from Meera again. Like what was the point of that journey? What would Meera think about him being the fucking King.
He just fucking dumps Meera with next to no emotion and people still think this emotionless robot should be King.
I hate bran, completely not thrilled about him getting the throne. But I truly don't believe Bran played everyone to get throne. Martin's end game was for someone who does not process any desire for power, greed, and vengeance to sit on the throne. Bran is the only one who fits that category. However, its hard to say for certain because the writers did such a shitty job with Bran's character, we have no idea wtf is actually going on inside his head. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvidence to support Bran's complete loss of any \"wants\" as he described it to Tyrion is his convo with Jaime in the Godswood. Jaime asked why he didn't tell everyone the truth about his fall. Bran replied \"you won't be able to help in this fight if I let them murder you\". Bran has no desire for justice or vengeance for what was done to him. Therefore his decision making process is one that completely lacks all personal desires. Which often corrupts the mind. \n\nJaime being sentenced to death for his crimes against Bran would have been just for the starks and bran but not necessarily the benefit to the realm at that time.
He's been manipulating events the entire time most likely...they just cut the show waaaay to short to go into those details.
There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever Bran has been manipulating anything outside of his throwaway \u201cshy do you think I came all this way\u201d line. I agree he *could* be manipulating things, but that is never remotely explained or developed upon
Bran is actually just Littlefinger. Littlefinger became a faceless man ya know? Bet your expectations are subverted
I like to think when he yelled \"FATHER!\" at the Tower of Joy, it gave Ned the idea to adopt Jon.
Especially from a character who doesn't consider himself human anymore and has said he doesn't want.
Imagine, creating a genius of evil w/o realising it. I knew they were bad but this... This is next lvl. Its so baaaaad its almost art
What's sinister about it? He repeated that he doesn't want to be King 2 minutes later. He came all this way because he knew he would be chosen and was willing to take on that responsibility, that's all.
\n> What's sinister about it?\n\nBecause it briefly implies he was manipulating events the entire time.  \n\n> He came all this way because he knew he would be chosen and was willing to take on that responsibility, that's all.  \n\nSo lets ignore the fact his election makes less sense than the tuxedo football scene in *The Room* - The question everyone should be asking is Why? Why is he willing to take on this responsibility? His whole point was that he was not Bran Stark anymore and that he wouldn\u2019t be the lord or ruler of anything? Why does Bran give a shit? His whole plotline has been *explicitly* about the great threat of the NK and how \u201conly he can stop them\u201d. He has never been involved with the KL storyline and his character has never had anything to do with either wanting to rule the kingdoms (like Dany) or being elected to positions of power (like Jon).  \n\nI *guess* you could make the argument that was the point and the kingdoms needed and desired a different kind of ruler but that also makes no sense because 1) hardly anybody in the dragonpit meeting even knew who Bran was, let alone what the 3ER is, and 2) the thematic principles of S8 (as awful as they were) is that development doesn\u2019t really matter and you just end up back where you started. But this theme is also kicked out the window at the end (or at least that was the intention) with Bran as king (which made no sense) and a mostly low-born small council (which also made no sense).  \n\nI just don\u2019t get the point of Bran or the point of the final message? I guess the point of the final message is inherent impossible to grasp because the *how* of the final message makes no sense, but the purpose of Bran could\u2019ve at least been explained - but nope, we don\u2019t even get a tiny bit of explanation into Bran\u2019s ultimate motives
\"WE\" still don't know fuck all about Bran...\n\nThat's such a huge assumption by people who don't know much about the show...\n\nIf you know everything about time and space- if you have cosmic knowledge, all of reality is spoiled for you.  You'll always know where to be and when to be.  It's the point of the 3 Eyed Raven.  He is ALL history All memories and all knowing... He's lost all enjoyment and excitement of life because he knows EVERYTHING.\n\nThis is why he never moved when the Night King was approaching him.  He knows Arya will kill him.  He's not Bran, he's the 4th wall breaking viewer of the series.  Imagine being told ALL of the story of Game of Thrones--Now you're a character in the story.  You'd always know where to be, what to do, etc.\n\nJust because you don't comprehend a story doesn't mean your ignorance gets to be the deciding factor in something.\n\nYou. Know. Nothing.
Well I liked most of the arcs, even Brans for the most part
Wanting the throne and deserving the throne are very clearly shown as two separate things throughout the season. Bran isn\u2019t saying he came all this way because he wanted the throne the whole time, he came all this way cause he wants what\u2019s best for the realm and that\u2019s him being king
Okay fair point. But Bran has never shown any qualities that in the eyes of 99% of Westeros' inhabitants would make him deserving of throne
~~It's so 2000s action movie ending line~~ \n\nIt's so 2000s *straight-to-DVD* action movie ending line
It\u2019s so 2000 *made-for-tv* movie ending line
Obviously because he sees it as his duty and \"what must happen\" according to his knowledge. That doesn't mean he wants it ??? Yes the script was really bad at times, but so is this complaint
>letting hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians die\n\nThis implies that he could have done anything about it to  begin with. Do please tell. How could Bran have stopped any of those events from unfolding? Not defending the show, cuz it turned to shit, but this seems unfounded.
Bran didn't have to tell Jon about his true heritage. Also since Bran can probably see glimpses of the future, and also has infinite knowledge of the past why didn't he tell Dany to use the secrete passageway which Jaime used to send some elite soldiers to go kill Cersei? Not to mention Bran would know that Euron had equipped his fleet with a whole boat load of scorpions and could have saved her dragon. It looks to me like he subtly manipulated events to go his way, even though Dumb and Dumber probably didn't intend for that to be the case
And he even insisted multiple times before when others pointed out that he was the rightful Lord of Winterfell that the 3 Eyed Raven can't be a Lord.
Exactly
They apparently cut a scene that showed exactly that Arya or Sansa and Bran conversation.
I thought that him becoming the 3ER so quickly basically fried is brain in a way. Since he really wasn't ready to be the 3ER. Maybe the OG was ready. Idk, just how I interpreted it I guess.
This is how I see it. I mean, he was pushed to become the 3ER too soon because of his own mistake of letting the Night King touch him in his vision. Then, his most loyal friend (Hodor) had to be sacrificed so he could survive - and Bran was the reason he talked like a Pok\u00e9mon. Robo-Bran seemed to be more like a coping mechanism than a side effect of being the 3ER
That's what I thought too, but I think they should've just made him be like that for the rest of season 6 and the first bit of season 7, give him some time to come back to normal and have actual character development.  After all, he was still emotional when he plugged into the tree and learned about Jon when telling Meera \"I'm the three eyed raven now, I have to do this.\"\n\nBut then after that he's just \"beep boop \ud83d\udcdf \ud83e\udd16\". Pretty much ruined his character making him so boring and truly a disservice to Isaac H. Wright by giving nothing interesting to do for the rest of the series.
I think part of it is that the character is a lot harder to translate from book to screen than others. I think the showrunners lost investment in the story and they ended up not doing the work to translate the character well, so we got stuck with robo-Bran. Idk still stupid.
Or Moonboy for all I care. No way to learn that given the question that was asked.
I think it's safe to presume that Bran is nowhere near 'second-favorite Stark'.
oh!
Vegisexual
It's spelled vedgetabel, right?
Agreed, Ned was a great character. He really was the one to get everything rolling.\n\nSansa is also pretty aight, wish she had done anything in season 8 like actually contesting Dany after she murdered Kings Landing, probably would have made her my favorite.\n\nThe other Starks are aight to meh,\nJon and Arya are just huge Mary Sues with a shit ton of plot armor and both were kinda ruined by season 8. \nCait had less depth when compared to the books. \nRob has always been a rather minor character. \nRickon is a joke.\nBran is straight up a huge plot hole.
I think she needed to spell it out for Jon as he seemed to be a bit slow in season 8.
SHE IS MAH KWEEN
It's like he knows nothing
First rule of great screen-writing (by D&D): tell, don't show.
She also spent 8 out of 8 seasons murdering various people, but sharp catch by Arya there.
That was horrific writing. My friend and I actually laughed \u201clike no shit she\u2019s a genocidal maniac not a killer.\u201d
What did you expect? Good dialogue from the writers? Haven\u2019t you heard? They got better things to do now...
>Yeah and dany was insane, Jon was stupid, Geoffrey cruel, Tommen weak, Tywin ruthless.  Each characters qualities whether they be likable or not contributed to this amazing story.\n\nThank you! I never got the hate for Catelyn. She wasn't one of my favourites, but I really liked her. I don't know. Did she have some irritating moments? Yeah. And as you said, SO DO ALL THE CHARACTERS. Even Jon, for fuck's sake. And I don't see as much hate in those cases lol
dunno, she was irredeemable for me. Acted like a cunt towards Jon who didn't do anything and then betrayed Robb by releasing Jaime like a stupid cunt
So he has 1 thing to Bran at least since he could walk. That's good to know :P
The S7 and S8 trope of Tyrion blindly trusting Cersei at every turn just made no sense whatsoever. The dude knows better than anyone that she's a back-stabbing bitch mainly out for herself. What the hell made him think that she would risk thousands of her soldiers when she instead had the opportunity to have Daenerys Targaryen and her entire forces obliterated?\n\nThen again, her being back-stabbing also changes depending on whether it's convenient for the plot. She sends Bronn to have Tyrion executed with the same crossbow he killed Tywin with, but for some reason no one has explained to me yet, she doesn't immediately kill him, Dany and her advisors or Drogon when they're all in range for the dozens of scorpion bolts ready to fire at them at Missandei's execution.
Tyrion as a character had to explain the poor writing every time he said \"I made a mistake. I shouldn't have trusted Cersei. I thought she had something to fight for.\"
She tried to kill him. Did he forget? Like dafuq? That whole thing was huge and made him hate everyone in KL.
Cersei kind of forgot she wanted to kill Tyrion.
It's probably because she let Tyrion know that she is pregnant. Anyone watching the show knows that Cersei is COMPLETELY driven by her children.  \n\nWhether Cersei thought the NK would actually get to Kings Landing or not, Tyrion thought that she wouldn't risk letting her child be destroyed by the WW.
I think Tyrion's plan was to get the throne at the end. He was playing Machiavelli. I mean, why snitch on Varys? It seems like he was manipulating people to turn on each other except his siblings. If this is the case, the director failed horribly at portraying this. It just doesn't make any sense how the characters acted so stupidly in the end compared to the early seasons.
That entire fucking episode of \u2018walk and talk for 20 steps, then stop and poignantly look into the distance,\u2019 was such bullshit. People loved it at the time however.
It was pointless at the time, but I kept holding out hope that there would be some payoff down the line... But no...
The annoying thing is they didn't even need a Dragon to cross the wall. They could just walk around the pass on the western side of it.
>It was pretty clear that the writers knew they wanted the NK to have a dragon.\n\nIf they only wanted NK to have a dragon they could have found a dead *somewhere* for him to raise.
>Cersei made it seems like she would be convinced?\n\nRemind me to murder the inventor of the withheld information trope. And the [Unspoken Plan Guarantee](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee) trope. I hate them with a vengeance and classify them as \"How to give dramatic revelations a half-hearted attempt by being vague.\"
If you think about it these  guys are rich and all they have to do is find a creative way to give the NK a dragon.\nAnd thats what they come up with.
I'd say losing only half your forces against a neverending army of the undead is a pretty good score.
This will also happen
Maybe add some rank-order questions instead of absolute or check all that apply questions. \n\nFor worst decision, maybe have us rank order a list, e.g., (1. Jon et al trying to capture a wight 2. Ned trusting little finger/warning Cersei beforehand 3. Dany listening to Tyrion about Cersei/not going off to burn the iron fleet/not attacking KL/anything 4. Queen Cersei choosing to not have at least one child by Bobby B 5. Robb agreeing to marry a Frey girl and then reneging 6. Oberyn not finishing off the Mountain/standing too close while interrogating him) \n\nDefinitely re-ask the who should\u2019ve died question with almost all of the characters sill alive (J, S, A, B, T, ST, G, P, Bron, BoT) and use rank-order. Same with who do you wish had lived longer or to the end. \n\nFor rank-order Qs you can analyze them by assigning point values for each rank then averaging across users: 1=10 pts, 2=9 pts ... (or how ever many options you list 1=5 pts, 2=4 pts). \n\nGreat job on these btw!
The idea of starting a rewatch and knowing that is going to be the end just puts me off.
Ah, I was saying that because almost none of the characters got the ending in his arc. For example, all the scenes of Arya being obsessed with Cersei, all the scenes of the NK vs Jon Snow stare-off, etc. They have no meaning in the \"end game\", so I lost my interest to all of them.
I just think he\u2019s so honorable he wont go back to Winterfell just to show he accepts the decision. Which is completely stupid. Futhermore, they dont need a nights watch anymore.
Right? The white walkers are dead and the wildlings are friends, what the fuck are they guarding against now?
That's the point I think
Yes Sansa is a Queen and can pardon him or give him sanctuary
Everyone seems to miss the fact that the whole point of this was to break the wheel and that can't be done by going back on deals. Jon is exiled. If he just goes to chill at Winterfell and Dany's remnant finds out, they march on Winterfell. The Ironborn join them. Does Bran, who isn't even Bran, send his armies to aid his family, even though they subverted an official sentence? Would that not make them enemies of Kings Landing? Bran won't give a shit but the other Lords might not appreciate the North having free reign to do whatever they want.\n\nKeeping Jon in exile, while sucky, blocks events that could spiral into new wars, and then where the fuck are we? Right back to the Game.
That works well if all of Danny's remaining supporters weren't on a boat heading for Naath before Jon even left king's landing
Yeah but D&D are going to subvert expectations and ruin it *more*
Honestly? I think Star Wars would be perfect for them. They chose cisual spectacles over story this season on Thrones, and I think that would suit Star Wars fairly well
It was interesting until he returned to castle black. From that point forward he just sat around doing nothing except saying something creepy once an episode.
Meera fans represent.
Osha as well
Why were they not at the council along with whatever lady is currently head of house Frey, and all the other nobles houses
I agree the end of Bran's story was dumb and pointless, but his journey has been the most interesting and intriguing to me through out the show - just to show a different opinion
Honestly, it always bored me personally - I just didn't find it or him interesting, and when he came back after being absent from Season 5 I just didn't care at all anymore.
Seriously, it's like that in Itchy and Scratchy episode 2F09, when Itchy plays Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone, he strikes the same rib in succession, yet he produces two clearly different tones. I mean, what are we to believe, that this is a magic xylophone, or something? Ha ha, boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.
I guess it\u2019s just me, but I read that as \u201che came all this way\u201d because he knew he had to be king in order to \u201cbreak the wheel\u201d. Idk maybe I\u2019m giving them too much credit, but I actually like the Bran on the throne decision. What I can\u2019t agree with, is the lack of a natural storyline to get there. Like they should\u2019ve shown Bran using his powers to make correct decisions about some events between him becoming the 3ER and now, to at least give a viable reason for him being a good king. Instead he was just cryptic as shit and confirmed R+L=J, and that\u2019s pretty much it.
They've already said no spinoffs with the current characters. I think arya exploring west would be pretty shitty honestly.
Well no. That was the thing. He originally wouldn't do it, but Varys convinces him:\r\r> What about the lives of your children, my lord? Is that a precious thing to you?\r\rYes, he's leaving his kids. But presumably they would be with the Lannisters, which obviously that's better than them being dead. (For all Ned knows, they could be tortured or killed if he doesn't give a confession)\r\rAlso Cat and Robb are still alive, so they could hopefully get the kids back at some point.
That's why he finally choose to recognize king Joffrey as the true king, before getting his head chopped off anyway. Which makes his end even more tragic, frustrating and schoking. They break him, and he accepts his entire life of honor to be destroyed, for nothing.

Then why was everything green and full of green grass and trees when they showed the scene of the night king's creation. That was \"beyond the wall\" as well. (the wall wasnt technically there yet but the location is north of the soon to be built wall)
I mean basic story telling, if you read, watch or write a story and the first reaction to something that happens is \"wow thats kinda dumb, why wouldn't they just do/say ______\" then its bad writing. \n\nLike with the battle of winterfell, did they make the battle plan by our heros stupid because otherwise it would have seemed like the night king and his army wasn't that strong? if thats the case make the battle plan by our heros water tight, have it on paper so that by all accounts they should win the fight, then just make the night king that much more that even the best plan is nothing compared to him, they spent 7 seasons building up how the nk and his army are the unstoppable death of the world so there was no risk of him seeming \"to strong\" that was the point.
> \"This is a fantasy series with dragons and magic, it doesn't have to make sense!\"   \n\nIn other words, \u201cJust don\u2019t think about it\u201d
That argument is exceptionally stupid for Game of Thrones, because what the series has always excelled at is that even in a world with magic and heroes and prophecies that really come true, *the politics make sense.*
I wish they never chose D&D in the first place, i knew it was inevitable that they'd fuck it up, cause i don't think anyone had ever heard of Dan Weiss before GoT, looking at his IMDB page and it's completely empty other than very very small projects. And Benioff made that Wolverine Origins movie which was horrible. I wish they'd grab someone like Guillermo del Toro, cause i think around the time they cancelled him for The Hobbit, they were starting to make GoT.
Yeah, seriously, you could make the same argument for Marvel movies which basically have what amounts to magic and fantastic creatures.
Someone fetch the westeros stretcher
Nah, the main characters just learned Instant Transmission from Goku.
[deleted]
Wasn't that during Robert's Rebellion?
And when she asked if he could forgive him he didn't even respond
Maybe if you just throw a bunch of symbols together it will mean something?
I swear the writers were purposely fucking with us.
That\u2019s what makes Bran being king so intriguing and why it\u2019ll probably be done much better if ADOS ever comes out. Before with the Night King you could justify Bran\u2019s letting everything happen like Theon\u2019s death because it all culminated with the killing blow that saved Westeros. And now he\u2019s probably let thousands die to become King, which was never even close to being part of his story, and yet all that time spent with the 3ER that we didn\u2019t get to see had to have been about becoming King. I really hope the prequels delve into this stuff more because it seemed like the end of GoT was a victory for the 3ER alone; Bran becoming King had to have been decades in the making, plus some evil 3ER\u2019s would be dope.
Dany is killing innocents because SHE thinks it\u2019s needed for her kind of \u201cgood\u201d; and she was gonna kill millions of others in order to reach her goal. But with Bran letting her kill those millions and setting up the distrust in her in the first place, he assured that she would be killed and couldnt kill more. I guess people see it as \u201che caused Dany to kill a million\u201d but I see it more as a \u201che made sure she couldnt kill MORE than a million\u201d. You could say that he couldve tried to make it so she wouldnt kill a million in the first place, but maybe this was the only way to reduce her kills while also breaking the wheel for the a better distant future.\n\nTotally agree, there really isnt a good, right proper answer, at least until the books!
That stills has the implication that Dany was *right* to torch King's Landing though, if that was the best future from Bran's perspective
The visions are somewhat unclear, but I don't think he can scan the future and act to change it. He only ever acknowledges the fact that events happen because they *have* to. He gives meaning to what happens a posteriori, but he doesn't act to change it in advance (because he can't really know what will happen).
He already manipulated events with Hodor. It's obviously possible.
Or the first responses could've been Bran lying. \n\nIf the 3ER were lying in the end, he'd have no reason to have told the truth in the beginning in the first place. I think it's more plausible that he's been telling the truth the whole time.
The future may not have been changed by Jon\u2019s choice. If Jon had not said anything there is no guarantee Jon\u2019s heritage could not have been found out a different way. Maybe Sam decides he needs to tell someone for revenge? Maybe Tyrion over hears Dany and Jon discussing it? The fact that Jon did spill his secret was a betrayal to Dany which escalated her \u201cmadness\u201d, but it still could have played out the same. The news gets leaked without Jon making the choice,  but Dany feels unloved because the people love Jon. Jon stepped back from Dany the moment he learned of his heritage and I believe that hurt Dany as much as him spilling the news. She chose fear when Jon refused her love. She still lost people close to her which also played into her reaction at KL.
He can't see the future, he only knows that things move in a deterministic way and that whatever happens is what *has* to happen. This has always been his attitude since becoming the 3ER. He doesn't push for things to happen, he just acknowledges that there is only one way they could have happened.
First Bran can't see the future, he can only see visions, out of context scenes that may happen, but the show does a really poor job explaining us what his powers are so I really can't blame you\n\n\nSecondly, do you have a girlfriend? Imagine you have done something bad and your best friend comes over \"TacoMagic it's your choice if you want to tell her what you did\"\n\n\nIs there any possible outcome where you don't tell her and don't spend the night on the couch?
So he's afflicted by visions... of the future... that don't make any sense and he can't do anything with... sounds like a fun ability to have... like a stroke jumping tv channels that he can share with others but it ultimately means nothing because the ink is dry... hurray...\n\nI would not conflate to \"Jon knowing his true identity\" and then telling his immediate family, the thing he literally just said he was going to do.. as \"hiding something from my girlfriend she eventually finds out and I sleep on a couch\" ?\n\n\"Why do you think I came all this way\"\n\n\"It's your choice\" \n\n3EyeRaven playing these fools.
He coulda told arya about the fate of kings landing if he knew, arya would believe him cuz he knew of her list, sansa knows of her faces, and believes bran has \"visions\". Arya could just assassinate danny wearing a face of anyone. Hell danny called her hero of winter fell, she sees arya as no threat to her life anyways even if word gets to her of aryas powers.\n\nIf bran knew and didnt get arya to kill her first.. that to me is weird logic
Really? I\u2019m like the complete opposite. Even as a kid, I was rooting for James Bond to die in Goldeneye just because I liked Sean Bean as 006 so much.
>006\n\n007*\n\nEdit: I apparently need to relearn how to read. Ignore me.
Rob and Jon were boy scouts, too.
Oh I must have missed how they counted every variation of every word.
Personally I don\u2019t expect OP to pay for a program to do something that is not necessary. I don\u2019t know about you
I mean if I'm planning to analyze >100k qualitative data points I would. Although I'm sure there are open source alternatives that can do this.
It deserves as many upvotes as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had nobles.
And it died at the hands of a Frenchman of all things...
    it had a degree of religious tolerance that was missing from England, Spain and France\n\nYou're joking, right? The 30 year's war didn't happen? And the only reason it didn't kick off much sooner was because the HRE was not a state but a loose federation.
You will note how I qualified that in the statement you are replying to and then realize why your response is missing the point.
If Bran is immortal, why was he worried about the NK killing him?
I think he meant to say that Bran can't die of age, so he would live forever if not killed. Personaly, i don't subscribe to that theory, cause the previous three eyed raven only lived that long by merging with a weirwood tree. I doubt that's a possibility for bran as king.
Because the writers wrote that. It doesn\u2019t make sense just because it was written. Why would the white walkers target Wikipedia instead of the A10 Warthogs? Just because Bran was worried, it doesn\u2019t mean it was justified. Out of all the things that don\u2019t make any sense, Bran being worried about dying doesn\u2019t really rank high up the list.
Immortal\u2260Invincible.
That's 4 years old, and it is exactly my point.   \n\nThis season,  she just repeats it like a catch phrase, and it certainly doesn't mean what it did in that clip.  She used it a chant to fire up her army to go and conquer all known lands.\n\n\"Daeny kinda forgot what 'break the wheel' meant.  But the wheel didn't forget about her.\"  if I can be allowed to meme about it.
D&D realized that Dany breaking the wheel was a little too sympathetic because *almost every other character on the show* wants to keep the wheel regardless of their sympathetic perspectives.\n\nIt would literally become Dany versus everyone. Which would be entertaining as all hell, but it would also mean half, if not most, of the audience would find themselves rooting for Dany against the entire Stark family. Which would also be incredibly entertaining but hard to write around.\n\nBasically, the Great Houses are the wheel. How do you write a show where all of the good guys support a horrible system that only one or two of the good guys want to tear down? D&D broke in favor of a fucked-up system that likeable characters mindlessly support instead of a morally grey and sometimes divisive character tearing down the fucked up system that the likeable characters mindlessly support.\n\nWhich is why Tyrion straight-up lies at the end and says that Dany's dream was to make sure the spokes on the wheel stay intact.
Yet people wanted to name the episode \"The Broken Wheel\".  Sorry but to me that's a horrendous name, even with any sort of context, purely for the sake of #***SYMBOLISM***
~#Hashtag~
> That's what I call \"breaking the wheel\", at least in the world of ASOIAF.\n\nno, no no no, no. not at all.\n\nWhat you described is her being a spoke in the wheel, exactly.  And when she dies and has no kid, yet another succession war breaks out between everyone.  The wheel turns once more,  and the people suffer for it.\n\nWhat you describe is exactly the wheel, and Daeny keeps the wheel going full force.\n\nObviously,  breaking the wheel is a democracy/republic and a peaceful transition of power.   No more rights to the throne, no more birthright, no more 'name',  but replaced with people peacefully voting to elect a leader whose job is to serve the realm.  The exact opposite of Daeny and the \"Conquer the World\" message from the latest episode.
We've had medieval kings who specifically took power away from nobles and empowered commoners precisely because the nobles held enough land and wealth collectively to challenge them. Dany's plan wasn't anachronistic, and giving nobles the power to choose their king has more often than not led to more conflict than disempowering them.\n\nThe interesting thing is that a perfect situation for this is a character like Dany who can't follow hereditary succession. She wouldn't want power to be passed down generationally, especially given her experience with corrupt and bloodthirsty Targs and Lannisters.
You could see in his face that he didn\u2019t really mean those things. He was in a tough spot and really wanted her to be good but you can see the anguish in his face while saying those lines to Tyrion. He was having an internal battle of \u201clove vs duty\u201d He wanted her to be his queen and be good so bad that he was trying to convince himself that she was and at the end of the day he knew what had to be done. Sometimes when it\u2019s something that you want so bad but you know is wrong, you need some outside perspective to make the right choice. It\u2019s just like a lot of real relationships when you know you shouldn\u2019t go back with your ex but you do anyways. Jon just needed a friend to put it in perspective because he was blinded by love
That's the problem none of what you said is believable. That scene should feel like that but it just reads like a mix of stupidity and a little of bit of loyalty. Very uncharacteristic, and all to quickly push towards a quick resolution.\n\nJon was made stupid in general and they forced in an unbelievable love/loyalty to fill in any remaining games. He was just a tool to push certain plot points and ultimately made him useless wood as a character.
I agree but 51% did not
I was angry about the ending at first because It didn\u2019t make sense due to how rushed it was. But once I connected the dots through all the recaps and cast interviews I was able to make sense of It all and think It was a good ending. It was just executed absolutely terribly.
Yeah he did say that didn't he. The realm is so screwed
I was running under the assumption that Bran has forfeitted his claim on the North.  \n\nAlso Sansa was Lady of Winterfell when she declared independence, which made her Queen regardless.
It's been going on longer than that.
The lord of light wanted Danny dead?
Nah, he wanted Dany to help. Dany dying would only happen when the Lord of Light \"fucks off\".
would he have needed to be killed like that if Jon's plan hadn't given him the GD dragon in the first place?
Why is such a sensible post buried in this thread? It baffles me that there\u2019s so many people who failed to realize Jon\u2019s entire purpose and why he had to be a half Targ.
Thank you, it\u2019s been hard to find others who agree
Nah I don\u2019t see it that way, he was brought back to bring dany into the fold to defeat the night king and the kill dany before she become too powerful. He purpose was always to kill dany, and to help the defeat the NK not necessarily to kill him himself. When Melisandre goes to dragon stone she said to dany, you and the king in the north both have a role in this war. Danys purpose was served when the NK was defeated. It was only Jon left with one more purpose, kill dany.
Within the show, sure. But of course that raises the question of why the lord of light gives a flying fuck about Dany being alive/dead.
Except the night king got past the wall much faster with the dragon, Dany would probably have time to beat Cersei and take the kingdom pretty fast (even the North had Jon stayed dead). Also, the nk dying the way he died could have happened anywhere, anytime. Bran could have just seeked Arya, waited for a bit for him to show up, and have her ninja her way into killing him.
You think Arya/Sansa/anyone in the North is okay with Dany taking Winterfell? Dany probably kills all the Starks as she burns Winterfell down. The only reason that fight against the dead is close is because of the unity between Dany\u2019s forces and Jon\u2019s forces. Without him the Night King would find a way to win.\n\nAnd, again, even if this wasn\u2019t true. The Red god is a cruel one. It doesn\u2019t *need* to narratively pay off any more than Robb being the king in the north was
Nope. Drogon obviously showed interest in jon in multiple scenes in s7 and 8.
He looked at Jon a few times, therefore Drogon wouldn't kill the person that killed his mother?
It's implied that Mirri Maz Duur infected his wound worse instead of trying to heal it, but yeah. Point still stands.
In the books she tried to heal him but he rubbed sand on his wound(and it's implied she knew he would do that) and it got fucked up further. It's quite confusing
That's the power of the theatre, bitch.
Drogo was killed by the witch though
>I find the Hound's survival less likely than Arya's but people don't go on and on about that.\n\nI agree, Hound should have died. \n\nA \"small knife?\" Look at this [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/h8U43CI.jpg). Looks pretty damn long to me and the Waif buries that thing to the hilt twice and twists it around after the last stab. And you can't be serious about the lower right abdomen not containing any vital organs. That blade was going right in the approximate area where you'd find the right ascending colon and packed coils of ileum and jejunum.
No vital organs as in the stab wound is not going to kill you like if you got stabbed in the heart.  Its the risk of infection, which is likely but its not guaranteed.  I would have preferred them be less dramatic about it yes, but it is not immersive breaking.
See, but I don't think that's satisfying. I get it, life is tough, not everything has a happy ending. But him going back is just not narratively fulfilling. It's like you said, him dying while killing Cersei is palatable, but it's certainly not a happy ending.\n\nUsing your analogy, if I were to watch a story about a drug addict, where he spent the entire film getting rid of it, only to give in in the last 10 minutes and die of overdose... I'd leave completely unsatisfied. I guess that's the point, but it feels cruel just to send a message of \"sometimes things are cruel\".\n\nHe spends 8 seasons struggling with that. At the season 6 finale, he looks both pissed and disappointed at Cersei when he watches her sitting on the throne. Only for him to go back. Feels like an utter waste
Indeed. Which is why I said \"on the context of the show\". The books can have a lot of internal development and monologue. All D&D had to do was not feel obliged to keep the book's ending, and realize that the show is its own thing.\n\nWell, first they actually had to give a fuck to what they were writing.
Tbh D&D probably don't have the chops to make up their own ending to such a complex story to begin with (maybe if it's a generic fantasy story, but it isn't), so they continued to rely on Martin's plot points because at that point there's too much of Martin's touch for them to just abandon and make up their own plot points along the way. Don't think they could coherently bring converging storylines together without his bullet points, even Martin himself is struggling with this that's why his books aren't close to finished.
Interesting cause I totally disagree! I thought the execution was pretyy horrid too, but the bullet points make sense to me.\n\nBran ending up king reminds me of King Leto II in Dune, a ruler who knows the best possible outcomes for humanity. I dunno I just find it more interesting then Dany or Jon ending up on the throne. BUT, they did not do any work to make the ending work whatsoever.
Why even have a throne though? Isn't it clear that one person holding all seven kingdoms is fucked up?\n\n  \n\n\nHow about making all seven kingdoms independent again? I thought they were gonna do something like that when Drogon burned the throne, you know, symbolism and shit, but no... I guess he just wanted to burn it.
Thinking Arya has the most intriguing story and her winning the \u201cfavorite Stark\u201d vote is exactly why we ended up with her supermanning the Night King. It\u2019s fun to point fingers but I will always unequivocally hold you clowns responsible for liking her way too much and leading to the Long Night
Yeah I agree that it\u2019s completely silly to be intrigued by the person who can perfectly imitate anyone and is trained by some kind of crazy assassin school. Yeah, that\u2019s not even close to as intriguing as some of the regular people in GoT. You\u2019re right.
When I next rewatch the show I'm genuinely just going to imagine those storyline getting different endings and still enjoy the build-up.\n\n...at least, that's my hope, maybe I will fail :(
I'll just never re-watch it. There are too many deserving writers out there to waste time being reminded of this trash ending. Thank God D&D are going to Star Wars - a series that's already sucking cock in an alley for every dollar its worth.
The white walker threat was barely a threat lmao, like no one died, they didn't need cersei, they didn't need anything, the only reason the wall even falls is because of Jon's stupid northern expedition.\n\nTry again.
6 named characters died, including two who have been in the show from season 1. They didn't get Cersei, but Jon is responsible for getting Dany to the fight, unifying the north, and getting just about every member of the cast minus Cersei, Qyburn, and Euron there, ultimately. And yes, the wall falls because of him, another way his arc is significant, just as Ned's is significant even though he dies and screws his entire family.\n\nI'm not saying the white walker plotline this season is a masterpiece. But to say Jon's arc doesn't matter because he doesn't stab the night king is absurd.
\"What the hell is wrong with Critics?!  THAT WAS AN AWESOME MOVIE!\" Angry Joe Suicide Squad review.\n\nYeah, no, I wince every time Angry Joe steps outside his comfort zone of videogames,  his TV show and movie reviews lack nuance to say the very least.
Yea, it seems like choosing the lesser of two evils lol. But yea, the North also seems like a dreadful place to live, maybe that influenced a lot of choices as well.
That is what it ends up being, sadly lol That probably did, the south seemed beautiful. However I live in a place like the north irl anyway so it would not be much of a change lol
His men where in a very defensible castle
With no hope of relief against a much larger force.
With a few more episodes her turn would have been believable. The worst thing imo was choosing Bran while not even mentioning the only two legitimate claims.
Or even Gendry now that he was made legitimate.
That was the second worst thing for me. The only set up for that that I can think of is that in Winterfell Tyrion asked him about his story. That is literally it. Add to that he said he doesn't want anymore. However when it comes to being king it is a ln entirely different story. \n\nOn the Aegon side of things, I can see him not being king and I would be okay with it. The injustice comes that not even one person mentioned him. WTF. How can you not at least mention him?!
The rightful heir was Gendry Baratheon, legitimized son of the King of the 7 Kingdoms of Westeros, when they were last unified.\n\nBy any 'modern' Westerosi view, his claim is better than anyone's.\n\n(Edit for clarity)
They didn\u2019t even mention the idea of Jon being king. All the talks Varys and Tyrion have about how Jon would make a great king? For nothing. All of the letters Varys sent to the other lords revealing Jon\u2019s true heritage? Never brought up again.\n\nI mean we all know Jon \u201cdint wahnt it,\u201d and I\u2019m not even saying he should\u2019ve been king, but it should\u2019ve at least been discussed.
I think that was ultimately the biggest problem here. It felt really rushed. I think that they could have even made this ending work if they put more effort and thought into it. Just not a quick gathering out of nowhere that instantly decides who becomes king.
Not to mention that her ending speech to her soldiers was one of the most over-the-top evil speeches I\u2019ve seen in years. It felt like it was 1 step away from being a speech Hitler would\u2019ve given. So much for subtlety.
It might have actually been more subtle if she did the nazi salute at the end. \\s\n\nIn addition to the speach, I know the unsullied have always been a little robotic, but the whole scene had an autocratic feel to it.
Really? She's been really vindictive and brutal from day one....
There is a large difference between being harsh toward your enemies and setting hunting down innocent people as you burn the entire city.\n\nAlso note, there was a time her dragons torched a kid and she locked them away because of it.
I feel the same way. I am hoping that going back to season 7 and then reading some fanfiction that I might be able to make it alright in my head.\n\nI also hope GRRM finally releases the rest of it. Although I don't know how much more tragedy for Daenerys I can take lol
I wouldn't go that far. Season 1-4 were amazing. 5 was pretty good too, 6 was a mix and 7 was pretty bad in hindsight. Season 8 was like someone poured gasoline on a dumpster fire and then launched it into the friggen sun.
I wonder how much longer you'll continue to whine about it on the internet then? A few more weeks?
because it objectively is shit?
Objectively is the new literally I see
Didn't know about the Sansawinsfanclub but the DanandDavefanclub can not exist with a negative opinion on the show and asoiafcirclejerk is a joke subreddit as are all circlejerk subs.  These subs are hardly a fair bar by which to measure anything.  This sub has been the champion of the show when compared to the other two significant asoiaf subreddits on this site and most other asoiaf non reddit forums.  It isn't that the sub is negative, it is that the show tanked.
Dan and Dave fan club? I just threw up in my mouth.
Which honestly says a lot more about you than them. Really, stop shitting on other people who just want to enjoy something.
I don't want to watch star wars where a plot point is one character forgets that another can use the force. Im in 2 minds to not see it, but i really love star wars.
Disney should of realised that GRRMs books were carrying those two. D&D were only good when they adapted existing material from the book, not when they actually had to write (even then they had a blueprimt).\n\nIf anything Disney should of hited GRRM to write a trilogy, my god I would love to see that \ud83d\ude02
I was already kind of done with Star Wars, the Disney movies were disappointments for me and TLJ was the last nail in the coffin.\n\nNow it's like they're going to pry open the coffin, take a dump in it, and seal it back up again.
I'm just waiting for those two to also abandon starwars as they are offered another job somewhere else like they appear to have done with GoT
You guys sound like crazy people do you actually stop to read what you write? WTF am I reading here.
This exactly. Dany's forces were ridiculously overpowered at the end of Season 6. So the writers threw in a bunch of absurd *anti*-deus ex machinas like:\n\n1. Euron's ability to completely surprise and devastate her fleet even though she had Yara who is also a top notch Iron Born seafarer\n\n2. Taking Casterly Rock in a brilliant surprise assault only for Highgarden to fall like it was made of wet newspaper \n\n3. ~~Losing essentially all of her forces at the Battle of Winterfell~~, no that's not it, ~~only half were gone~~, no that's not it either, actually everyone respawned for the attack on KL\n\n4. Losing 2 of her 3 dragons, including Rhaegal to three \"360 No Scope\", \"1 in a million\" shots in 10 seconds after she \"kind of forgot\" about the Iron Fleet even though they talked about it in the same episode minutes before\n\nIt was all ~~a bait and switch~~ *subverting expectations* to make it seem like it was going to be a struggle, all for Dany and Drogon to dunk on Cersei and her armies like Lebron playing some kindergarteners anyway.
I blame the decision to cut Aegon.
Even the deus ex machina fail because if she can cause that mu h destruction with 1 dragons, why bother killing the second especially when in the next episode you bump up the power level by 9000
No one in their right mind would march their entire army to Highgarden and leave KL undefended. When you know someone is trying to attack. \n\nThe whole plot of attaching Harrenhal was dumb as fuck as well.
Yup. And in 7.01 she still had 3 dragons and there were no scorpions.  She could have burned the Red Keep without touching anything else and she would have won.
Literally barely even needs her dragons in 7.01. All that needs to happen is this:  \n\nTyrion - \u201cSo I destroyed the vast majority of Stannis Baratheon\u2019s fleet with wildfire and he still *nearly* took the city. You have way way more forces than Stannis did, so you will go to KL and have the Unsullied and Dothraki break through the Mud Gate and kill the Lannister army. The Unsullied do as you command and the Dothraki think you\u2019re a God so they won\u2019t rape and pillage if you tell them so\u201d. \n\nVarys - \u201cAlso, I know all the Red Keep passage ways. Why don\u2019t you send me with Grey Worm and a few of your other top Unsullied killers and i\u2019ll show them the passages to Cersei\u2019s room.  \n\nDany - \u201cGreat thinking boys. It\u2019s a plan!\u201d  \n\nYara - \u201cWell my Uncle  Euron has a huge fleet, what if they try to attack us?\u201d  \n\nDany - \u201cLol I have dragons\u201d.  \n\nYara - \u201cFair point\u201d.
I mentioned this same thing during 8.05, why the fuck didn\u2019t she just sack Kings Landing BEFORE the battle with the dead? If 1 dragon took it that easily then 3 dragons wouldn\u2019t have even needed a single ground troop to help. AND Cersei didn\u2019t have any scorpions then.
Because she listened to Tyrion's dumbass advice that's why.
in season 7 dany didn't want to burn the city and she thought cersei was gonna help against the dead until 8.02. there's a lot of things in the last four seasons that i thought didn't make sense but i don't think this one is anywhere near the worst offender.\n\nedit: as i've so far gotten three responses to this comment i thought i'd clarify. i agree that it doesn't make sense which is why i didn't say it did but i do think that it still fits with dany's goal of avoiding killing innocents in 7.01. we've seen in the previous seasons and the books that the red keep doesn't house just lannisters so it's not too unfair to assume that there are people who are relatively innocent living there. indimitation might work but she'd still have to demonstrate the power of the dragons to the lannister soldiers somehow. i agree that she could've and should've seiged the city at the start of season 7. i did forget that dany doesn't learn about the army of the dead until later on in the season and i don't think she believed it until 7.06.
At that point, they dont know yet the nightking is a pushover vilain so they think they need Cersei army against him
This. Episode 3 had lots of fanboys defending it but it was a trainwreck and killed 7+ seasons of build up and ruined multiple story arcs. It wasn't even one of the best battle episodes
Was the worst battle episode they had and the worst episode in terms of thematic butchering
I was in denial that it was bad...looking back arya killing NK was fucking lame.
Lol at least the NK got a dragon out of that and raised huge amounts of hype for season 8 (lol)\n\nIn this season every time someone did something incredibly stupid it had 0 payoff.
Yep.  As stupid as the whole thing was I was super excited that the Night King got a dragon.  In fact....the dragon battle between the Night King, Jon and Dany in E3 might be my favorite part of season 8.
[removed]
No, it\u2019s brainless to judge and be insulting someone who likes something different than you.\n\nGrow up...
If you factor in that is the finale and absolutely is a disastrous end to the show then yes.\n\nAs a standalone episode sure I'll give it a generous 3/4
I can see people giving it a 4, but 1? Is it the actual worst thing that you ever watched on television? Seriously?
Why. Arya is a much worse character
Both of them are completely selfish, but at least Arya selfishly wants to murder bad people, whereas Sansa selfishly wants to hoard power at the expense of her siblings and everyone else. Arya doesn't really affect anyone else, whereas Sansa just single-handedly destroyed Bran's kingdom because she's always wanted to be a queen since she was a little kid - not to mention that she may have driven Dany to madness by betraying Jon's trust. Sansa's selfishness has much larger negative effects.
I personally like both the show and the books; and can appreciate them for the aspects that each medium excels at.
if the books ever get finished, I'll probably give it a go again.  should be more enjoyable now that I know it's not high fantasy.
I DEMAND A TRIAL BY COMBAT\n\nBack when the writing was good
I hated that.\n\nGrey Worm: YOU WILL NOT SPEAK!\n\nTyrion: okay cool, but I'm just going to anywau
YOO, Arya and Yara have the same letters in their names
It\u2019s GOT\u2019s \u201cyour mother\u2019s name was Martha????\u201d Moment.
Found the guy who gave it a 10. ^\n\nKidding.
Why did Yara vote for the little brother of the dude that killed her queen she said she was still loyal to that she\u2019s never met? Tyrian\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t that good. Nothing about any of that episode made sense
Because Yara is secretely Jaqen H\\`ghar, duh
um.. she killed the nk?
She knows that how? Also, so? Since when did Yara become a sea bitch?
We didn't have any reaction to *Daenerys* dying. Drogon was the only person who gave a shit on screen.
Little bit from Tyrion and GW but nothing major yeah
> There's already a lot of suspense of disbelief required. So how come it's too difficult to just assume that Yara has been informed about the faith of Theon offscreen?\n\nI'm not saying that I don't believe that Yara was told about Theon's death offscreen, I fully believe that she was. My problem is that we got no acknowledgement of it at all. I felt like that was a really important moment that we missed so that we could watch Tyrian walk around King's Landing for a while longer.
Well, the entire ending felt a bit rushed. There was a lot they glanced over. That's indeed a bit of a problem I agree with. I still don't think that every character death needs to be accompanied by a scene where it shows how it affected their loved ones, especially given that Yara pretty much expected Theon and his comrades to die in their fight against the Night King.
Theon completed his arc, but I don't find the ending that satisfying. It's not problematic as all the other major characters, absolutely, but killing him felt very unnecessary and lazy even.\n\nPersonally, I'd keep him alive as right hand man of Sansa. I also feel like Jon should've died during his fight with the Night King, and then Sansa offers Longclaw to Theon, on an emotionally powerful scene similar to when Daenerys appointed Tyrion as her Hand.\n\nThere. The family that raised him, and that he once betrayed, now fully sees him as a man of honor and loyalty. Redemption arcs don't have to *always* end in death.
Yeah, Theon's death was unnecessary imo, which is why I said it was important only as far as he knew. Really he could've just hung back behind Bran and chilled while the NK took his sweet time and Arya did her thing. \n\nJon dying killing the NK would work, and would save us from three episodes of him serving absolutely no purpose.
Yeah that was as good as it got. Still, Cleganebowl felt incredibly forced. Cleganebowl is one of the best examples of forcing fan service. But yes, ultimately i guess it made sense, but I just didn\u2019t care by that point. It felt incredibly forced. But as far as thematic endings fir characters go it was fine
That was definitely my issue with Arya's arc this season, and a problem with the rushed pacing.  We know that Arya was consumed by revenge for a long time, and we could believe that her character to revert back to season 6 Arya and desperately want to kill Cersei.\n\nBut there is no buildup to how she regresses back, and no real reason why other than for the plot.  She already abandoned her first Cersei assassination mission after realizing she had family in WF, and unlike before, is actually close with Sansa.  She stresses to Jon again about the importance of family, and literally only a few minutes later in the episode decides to go kill Cersei and says she is willing to die to do so.  \n\nAnd the person who talks her out of her revenge mission at the last minute is Sandor, who suddenly decided to go on his own suicide mission to kill his semi-dead brother and is supposed to be the \"vengeful\" one of the two, when Arya was 10x times more vengeful than he ever was.
In season 1, when the Lannisters go after her father and she is practising with the sword master, she runs into the streets when a random boy grabs her and asks about her small sword needle. She reacts by stabbing him in the stomach. He falls and she keeps running. Later she tells the pie boy that she has killed a fat boy like him before and that he should be careful she doesn't do it to him too.  \n  \nEDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEvH5YCATg&feature=youtu.be&t=24
That was a reaction, not intentional.  Manslaughter at best.
I must be honest I forgot about that.
He was going to turn her over to the queen, who Arya probably thought would kill her
1) did you even read my comment?\n\nand if so \n\n2) did you even watch the episode? \n\nif so, refer back to question #1
I'm saying not only were the early seasons better written but they also had way better fights and action in the beginning . All the best fights are in the first 4 seasons. Season 7 skewed towards being just a battle/fighting season and wisely ignored politics/drama cuz they didn't know how to write it anymore. Season 8 skewed back towards drama and politics but it was all nonsense and pointless, it would've been better off being only battles and fighting.
yea thats my point, a lot of people who watch the show arent like us and are super super casual.
I can understand being casual. After all, not everyone can be super committed to things like TV shows, but there has to be a limit, right? \n\nApparently not lmao
Her name is Kelly C.!
Kelly C got mad about losing Miss Sandy
I\u2019ll take people calling her Khaleesi over the ones hat just call her \u201cthe mother of dragons\u201d
\"the dragon lady\"
It's not Khaleesi, it's Kelly C. Kelly Crazy.
so many poor little girls are named after a genocidal maniac
oh shit
Fair enough. I wish you good fortune in the gatekeeping to come.
Night gathers, and now my watch begins.
No, but to dismiss those people as not real fans, or to say \"they probably can't name five people\" is a bit ridiculous. I have a friend who is in love with the show, novels, etc. She knows all the characters, houses, mottos, stories, etc. And she LOVED this last season. Like, she understood the criticism and clearly saw that it was a bit rushed, but she would agree 100% with the people that say this season was \"Amazing\" or \"Satisfying\".
Jon wasn't sent to the Night's Watch to protect the Kingdom from wildlings or the NK.  It was an exile.  That was just a convenient place to exile him instead of Essos like Jorah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey didn't let Tyrion pick the king.  He nominated a king, pled his case, and the others agreed, for varying reasons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBran suffers from the same thing Dr. Strange suffered in Infinity War.  If you know how something plays out, you can't tell everyone or else it changes.  Like I said, D&D had a tough time explaining that, so they jumped a bit and excluded conversations...namely the Bran and Tyrion at Winterfell.  I can accept that they might have discussed this outcome, but you don't have to.  Bran will be the king in GRRM's book as well, so he might explain it, or he might never finish it because he can't either.  As I said, I understand it doesn't perfectly follow a logical progression, but there's enough there that I'm okay, knowing that they probably couldn't explain it neatly.  They didn't need to throw in a \"I saw 14,000,065 timelines and there was onle 1 we won\" line for me to accept it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat powers do you think Bran has gained?  He can see the past and the future, but it's not clear how much he is allowed to change them.  Time travel is tricky, and some amount of fans will always complain about it.  They're targeting Bran because he is the history of man.  They said it in the show.  You can accept that as their motive, or you can believe they have another motive that wasn't mentioned.  We don't need these mythical white walkers completely fleshed out.  We are mostly seeing them from the humans perspective.  They don't know everything about the white walkers, and since they don't know, us viewers don't.  We aren't seeing the show from the POV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think taking another person's face is as easy as killing them and removing it to wear.  There's some magic involved which requires body preperation like in the House of Black and White.  Let's not pretend that it would be a satisfying ending for the story if Arya just donned some faces and assassinated Cersei, Dany, whoever.  Based on the polls, people on this sub don't like Arya having this much influence on the show already, so what would giving her that many big kills do to stop the complaints.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I said, the story wasn't perfect, but you're pointing at all the flaws, big and small, that weren't criticized in seasons past.  Rewatch them and you'll find just as many inconsistencies or stories that just don't make total sense.
> They didn't let Tyrion pick the king. He nominated a king, pled his case, and the others agreed, for varying reasons.\n\nHandwaving away the motivations of the lord of six kingdoms as \"varying reasons\" is exactly what was wrong with the ending. The show is called Game of Thrones, FFS, and the game ended by three/four unfleshed characters aye-ing away their rights to become vassals of a random northerner without a claim to the throne.\n\nNo royal marriages, no scheming, no alliances, no promises, no compromises - just \"yup\".
Except Dr. Strange can see multiple possibilities whereas its not know what Bran sees, but its still morally disgusting. If Bran had acted who is to say the future afterwards would lead to a disasterous future???\n\nNow his king and he conveinently will now only change the future?
Sounds like he just bingewatched for the plot and not the universe. Pretty sad, but understandable.
That\u2019s kind of hilarious because it really does highlight people\u2019s hypocrisy.
There's no more Lannisters though. He's the warden of his own kingdom now.
But everyone is declaring indepence(well, at least they will after the King just let's his sister declares the largest kingdom to be independent) \n\nIt isn't the choice of lannisters or sansa\n\nIts the choice of sansa, Bran, or independence
\"UNPOPULAR OPINION, I liked it\" x100 gold
> This isn't just book readers nitpicking about their favorite theories not coming to fruition.\n\nYet this will be repeated ad nauseum by people who love to strawman criticism.
lol thanks! We kept putting off the show for years, despite all our friends saying we needed to watch it. So we said we'd watch 3 episodes and if we didn't like it, then we'd stop. \n\nWell, we never stopped
There really aren't meaningful discussions, there front page is essentially them hating on freefolk, mocking criticism and overall just circlejerking. \n\nThey reference a poll that interviewed 495 people and state that because 50% of thosd people enjoyed the season \"most\" people enjoyed the season. They honestly think 495 peoplr can speak for 20 million.\n\nThey also hate any criticism unless you overly blazt the season with compliments, every demoted commented is someone just criticising the show. Honestly, they are literally circlejerkimg and continuously have idiotic discussions on how S8 was so good, and if you try to explain that it was rushed - they dont care and downvote you.\n\nThat sub is by far the opposite of meaningful discussions, if you sift through free folk they have better discussions and on this subreddit. Contrary to popular belief those subs don't just have blind hate (the memes sometimes target nuance mistakes) and if you scroll down you can actually see criticism is downvoted for not being logical and manchildrrn comments are down there.
I can't agree with this, many people on /r/asoaifcirclejerk state in the comments that the season was rushed and mention specific things they didn't like about it, and I don't really see these points contested much there.  I also don't really see a lot of statements that the season was \"brilliant\" or \"best ever\".\n\nAs I see it, three things are being contested:\n\n1. the \"consensus\" that S8 was bad, that doesn't exist; the viewership is split on the issue.\n\n2. the notion that anyone who liked S8 must be an idiot (I have gotten replies to this effect myself here).\n\n3. various \"gaps in logic\" arguements being themselves illogical or ignoring previous parts of the show.
> you'd much rather have someone that the public loves be the final winner.\n\nNot necessarily, I just want an interesting character. If a character is interesting some people will want to see them win even if they're not widely popular. But for almost nobody to be interested in Bran is damning and shows what a terrible job D&D have done with the character. I'd have taken someone who was hated like Littlefinger or Ramsay over Bran any day.
Hell I thought Cersei was gonna wind up on the throne back in season 6. That would\u2019ve been much more interesting.
Oh, I concur, it's just the wheel thing itself was never really developed beyond it being said as a grand idea. But it was never really defined, nor how it would be changed.\n\nNot that I think a Grand Council couldn't break out into war/violence, but likely it may be better for the small folk.
i'm very confused
the wire, the sopranos, true detective season 1, breaking bad.\n\nwhy do you assume i hate everything. i just hate this show because i once loved it, and the reason for it being bad (or at least worse than before) are completely OBJECTIVE.
> the wire, the sopranos, true detective season 1, breaking bad.\n\nSorry, nope, those aren't good. You must be mentally challenged to like them. I would know, I don't like them, and therefore I'm mentally superior to you.
Practice makes perfect.
i think the point is more that it\u2019s really tiring being someone here who still enjoys the show, because saying that is like calling a lynch mob to your front door. \n\ncase in point: someone says they like the show and you come back with a snide remark. why are you so insecure that you need an echo chamber to validate your opinion? why can\u2019t people just say they like the show?
Yes, thank you :)
It is. They just wanted to bring some fake tension into the winterfell scenes and failed miserably
How about when he was led out as a prisoner to face judgement and everyone\u2019s like so Tyrion who should be king?
You're nuts.
Anything with a brain could do better than D&D for the writing. He isnt nuts
They deus ex-ed every major plot point in the story. 0 telegraphing, very little sense in the outcome.\n\nHowever they get points for style cinematography and artistry.\n\nYou know all the things that make them great to adopt source material into tv. Only problem is.. source ran out ...
Just like GRRM said, he developed his characters well, too well in fact that they all have their own personalities and he writes based on what their personalities act upon. \n\nThat's all D&D had to do. They written material that goes way outside of the character's personalities.
> I think that's implied pretty heavily with the dragon vision over King's Landing back season 6 or whatever it was.\n\nUnlikely since they didn't come up with many of these twists until after they shot season 6.
> The only person that D+D actually gave a good story arch is Theon. \n\nPartially because his story arc is almost complete in the books. We have yet to see the end, of course, but it doesn't take any more build up to reap the rewards which is the only new bit they tacked on.
So...weird lip service?  \"I don't want to be king, you know it because I said so, even though I appear to have done everything in my power to make myself king.  Also I said I can't be a lord and that I'm not Bran a couple of episodes ago, but now I'm Bran and I can be a king.
Most likely, however it\u2019s the writing that is the problem here. It\u2019s the way they got there not the actual ending that\u2019s the problem.
I mean, I'm sure GRRM also told them to try and least justify/show his deeper moments rather than some dead pan character
I'm not even sure Bran is alive in the show. It called itself the 3ER and kept saying it isn't human and showed no emotion at being reunited with its \"relatives\" so is there anything of Bran left in there? Is it just a flesh puppet warged into by a dying Brynden Rivers with access to Bran's memories? Is the 3ER some psychic parasite that's been jumping from host to host for longer than the Night King has existed and it finally gamed the humans into killing its only real threats *and* put itself in position to control them in one fell swoop?\n\nAnyway, I am sure we got the real endings for Dany, Sansa and Jon. Not so sure the same is true of the other characters and Bran, at the very least, must have a very different path since, as far as we know, there isn't even a Night King in the books.
There has been zero implication that the \"Three Eyed Raven,\" poorly explained concept as it is, was ever some force destined to be king.  The last one spent a century sitting in a cave.  Also \"I'm the Three Eyed Raven, I can't be lord of anything\" doesn't really jive with this.\n\n\nIf they want the entire plot to hinge on Bran's ascendance, maybe take two fucking seconds to make him a character, explain what he is or provide him with some motivation.
Actually, no. I\u2019m calling D&D terrible writers. They completely botched Bran\u2019s story line and character arch, which was devoid of any meaningful content the last two seasons. The problem is not that Bran became king, which I agree is likely GRRM\u2019s intention as well, the problem is how D&D got him to this point.
Yeah, he could be a little more human to Meera if he is capable of joking, thanking and ruling.
Ah another series that ended to poor writing; alad the Dexter series....
An entire team of people didn\u2019t see the discrepancy there. Tbh I feel it was an intentional misdirect and they hoped we\u2019d be too dumb to notice
Just saying that the old gods wanted him to would have sufficed, because they wanted to restore their dominion through Bran. It would have explained some.
LOL \n\nWe kinda forgot about the Old Gods - D&D probably
I think D&D literally *accidently* wrote a seriously sinister line without even realizing it
They subverted themselves.
Same...like he\u2019s a cripple and came all this way from Winterfell...he\u2019s never even been south of Winterfell in his life before.
He's the Three-Eyed Raven he's been fucking everywhere
Yeah all that went nowhere, they just dumped the fantasy aspects
Biggest letdown because that was my personal favourite part. I was dying to find out more about the NK, or the Gods, or the magic that brought back the dragons, or anything magically really. \n\nI feel like we learned nothing new about anything magical between S7-S8 when I thought that would be the most informative part.
They're leaving it for the prequels.
Ugh that would be even worse. Elaborating on WW lore despite the viewers having the knowledge that that whole plot is just belly shanked out of existence.
The *only* logical conclusion based on everything we saw is that the 3ER is an evil mastermind. If that is not what was intended, it speaks volumes about how badly the writing failed this season.
I think that's the only conclusion if you determine that the 3ER was in control of everything, but why do we think that? It seems possible that he was navigating events that he could foresee but couldn't control.
 *never remotely explained or developed upon* \n\nJust like Bran! It all fits together, see?
The fact that he gave Arya the dagger and only ever seemed to be interested in making sure Jon knew his lineage so he could have a falling out with Dany is evidence he was manipulating things. It is extremely unclear why he cared to wait for Jaime in the courtyard though as Jaime was relatively irrelevant.
The dagger is a massive stretch. It\u2019s never acknowledged whatsoever that Bran knows the future. It was pointless for Bran to keep the dagger. As for Jon - Jon\u2019s lineage is never mentioned by Jon or Dany after 8.02. His lineage only caused Varys\u2019 betrayal. His lineage had nothing to do with their falling out, that was all because of Dany committing genocide
No of course there isn't, but that's why I loved the finale so much; everything is open for interpretation.\n\nI do think that line was all they needed to throw in there to get the gears turning in peoples heads. They did what they could with 6 episodes.
Lol fair enough I guess.
I think Bran as depicted in this final episode is nothing more than an object in Tyrion's arc. He is elected because of some weird speech by Tyrion and is then shown to be completely uninterested in doing anything as King as Tyrion leads the small council meeting. Tyrion is essentially king at the end and is finally trying to do a good job and care about everyone or w/e. Bran became king because he is an emotionless husk who is useless and won't do anything selfish. However, I prefer an evil 3ER interpretation.
That\u2019s a fair argument. Still doesn\u2019t explain why anyone outside of Sansa and arguably Tyrion (who wasn\u2019t supposed to have power in that scene) want Bran as king.  \n\nSweet Robin would\u2019ve made about as much sense for king
His first action as the King: Bran says \"perhaps I can find him\" Find him for what? Maybe control him? Im 100% sure he is the true villain. And any writer worth anything would see that that's what you just set up :P
He does not imply that he was manipulating the events, only that he is a part of them. He has always and repeatedly said that everyone *has* to play their part, not that the part can be changed or manipulated. He has a purely deterministic view of the world.\n\nWhat he meant was \"I find myself here in front of you at this particular moment and not somewhere else because this is what has to happen\".  There is no free will, just a fulfilment of something that is predetermined.\n\nThis is the way Bran has behaved and spoken since he became the 3ER, only acknowledging that events have to happen the way they are set up to happen, and not differently.
And the predetermined worldview you describe only happens through characters and plotlines acting in utterly unrealistic and absurd ways
He has Wisdom.
Or you'd think he could have warged into drogon to stop dany
that's too petty a title for the 3ER. Nothing below King for him.
He obviously isn't, seeing as Jon is. However, there's no way to tell from the data in this poll what the distribution of people's second-favorites looks like (this being the distribution of first-favorites). Sure, Bran probably isn't the most common second-favorite, but given the questiom asked in this poll we can't know for sure.
I think it\u2019s safe to presume you picked the least important part of my comment.
Wait. No. Jon meant say \"I don't want it\"
Eyyy dun waahhnnt eet
DO Daenerys know da way?
Seriously, as if that was her first child.
As if she hadn\u2019t already pushed one of her children to suicide.
Characters forgetting things is the central theme of season 8.
Exactly; you'd think he'd realize by now that she didn't care for anyone ezcept for power.
Cersei only loves herself.
I mean...that's blatantly wrong. She clearly loves her children. She's just a psychopath about it.
They aren't its just a border town now.
Pretty sure there is no nights watch...the entire castle black is full of wildlings you don't see any crows. \n\nIt was just the players in the 7 kingdoms pulling a fast one on an outsider (Greyworm)
The realms of men.
There was no night watch at the castle. He ran off with the free folk. Hopefully he will use his leverage withbthe monarchs of the north and south to broker good trade deals for the wildlings .
Shadow cats, ice spiders, dire wolves. Pretty much stuff that was never mentioned in the show
The NK will rise again, and so will the white walkers.
I don't think the children would make the same mistake twice.
Winter is coming.\n\nThe most *chilling* of house words because it\u2019s always true, and now has a very permanent double meaning that they didn\u2019t realize was a reality. \n\nUntil the next generation \u201coh they\u2019re all dead you\u2019re crazy/no such thing. And the cycle repeats, but the north remembers
Snarks obviously.

No it was beyond the wall. You see the same arrowheadshaped mountain in the background as we saw in season 7 ep 6 \"beyond the wall\"
No it doesnt... it doesnt imply that she was right, just that she couldnt be stopped properly until after it (maybe killing her beforehand wouldve brought her armies\u2019 wrath to a larger portion of westeros and thus killing way more people)
I think he's trying to say her killing the city was the only way to get her followers to see the truth about her. (Mainly Jon and Tyrion). And once they saw the truth then they took action. I think it's telling that the Dragon and the Unsullied didn't kill Jon outright. I think that kind of shows that even they knew deep down that Dany crossed a line. That she had to cross the line so people could see the truth. Otherwise she would have stayed queen and the endless wars would have continued with deaths piling up but in small enough piles that you never realized the body count was so high until it's too late.
But why tho, I can see Bran being the bad guy but that would be really boring, you can literally find an extra, have him kill a bee and he would have more background as a villain than Bran\n\n\nI don't know, it sounds like D&D had no idea what to do with Bran so they just let him be a bystander that acts like a god and let the fans write a good theory\n\n\n[GRRM's thoughts about characters that turn out like Bran]( https://grrm.livejournal.com/82239.html)\n\n\nIMO this will be GRRM ending too but it will actually make a lot more sense, D&D just kinda took the idea and didn't even try to explain why
I think, if this happens in the books, it'll have quite a bit of creepier undertones. Bran's tutelage in the books is practically eldritch in its atmosphere, and Bran himself has been doing increasingly questionable, agency-ignoring things.
I don't think D&D knew why, so we don't know why. \n\nHere's hoping GRRM rocks it!
Sean Bean was 006 was he not? He didn't play James Bond.
Oh! My reading comprehension must have been non-existent when I posted that. I thought that they were saying they wanted Bean to be the next 007. \n\nRe-reading it now, I just definitely misread.
I would too, if I\u2019m getting paid.
Bran wasn't just worried. We saw the NK kill the other TER, and we saw him about to kill Bran. It's pretty obvious he isn't immortal.
Did the look on Bran\u2019s dopey ass face look worried?\n\nI agree with you that he isn\u2019t immortal, but I really don\u2019t think it matters to the story at all. After cameras started filming this season the writers made it clear that they don\u2019t give a fuck what happens after the cameras stopped.
OK, I'll concede yes, the TER is immortal in the sense that he can pass his consciousness on to another living person. This is what the old TER did as soon as he knew the NK would be coming for Bran. Bran never went through a similar process of passing on his knowledge to another person, so there was a very real chance he was going to die, and not be able to pass on his consciousness, and therefore not be immortal.
>think It was a good ending. It was just executed absolutely terribly.\n\nSo not a good ending.
For example danys arc is unreal did she go insane or did she make a conscious decision to rule with fear and tyranny. The show made it seem like a little of both. Makes no sense it\u2019s one or the other. Martin will clear that up for us.
Because a lot doesn\u2019t make sense.. but if you\u2019re a book reader you should have enough information to understand the ending. Martin will answer all our questions when he finishes his books. The show ending is his ending
Because she would have plunged the world into darkness with her tyranny. Duh
\ud83e\udd14
They weren't cool with the Boltons either, but wouldn't join the fight against them. Also the Boltons would be in power. \n\nThe NK did find a way to win anyway, and he died cause Arya is sneaky. \n\nRobb being king in the north did pay off. The red wedding is the payoff of that plot line. It doesn't need to be positive payoff to be payoff.
Strawman. You said dragons bond with one rider. Drogon clearly bonded with jon multiple times. They also bonded with tyrion in the crypts though you could argue that was just because they were chained up and wanted to be free
They didn't bond with Jon, they just looked at him. Dragons have one rider and they have killed other Targaryen such as during the civil war.\n\nDo you know what a strawman is?
No, in the books it's clear she was never trying to heal him. She is very strict about not removing the salve because it's actually a poison and abrasive enough that he would want to remove it. She ensures his death by convincing Dany it's going to heal him, then takes her son and any future children from her.
Yes it may not kill you near-instantaneously like the heart but if the bowels are lacerated death is still highly likely. They are highly vascular organs and the internal bleeding would have been massive and unstoppable without doing surgery. And it's not just infection risk as with any other wound. Bowel perforations leak bacteria laden fecal matter into the abdominal cavity\u2014it's a whole other level of fulminant infection.
It's complex, but it's significantly less complex than the books. Considering that, in an ideal world, they'd have to redo seasons 7 and 8, by the end of seasons 6, major characters that need resolution and/or converging are:\n\nDaenerys/Tyrion/Varys, Jon/Sansa, Littlefinger, Arya, Bran, Yara/Theon, Jaime, Euron and Cersei\n\nThe trickiest one is Littlefinger, and Arya considering what they did to her in season 6. It's perfectly doable with any amount of effort, and that's the thing: there was no effort. People have been throwing around the idea that D&D suck balls, but there's plenty of fantastic show-only scenes written by them.\n\nThey *can* write, they just were too lazy and uninterested these two last seasons. Which is probably even worse.\n\nAnd it might not be generic fantasy, but it's still a fantasy story. The ending didn't need to be \"holy shit, that was insane!\", it just needed to be satisfying I find. \"Bran drove Aerys mad by whispering 'Burn them all' into his ear\" would've been \"crazy\" enough I find, and then just finish your character's arcs in a way that makes sense.
I honestly thought Arya was great until she reached the faceless men, at which point her entire arc just becomes nonsense.\n\nIt's like the story bends itself backwards trying to make her cool, to the point where she just becomes a Mary Sue to me. Like the faceless men become incredibly inconsistent and nonsensical to justify her breaking away, and then her character basically just becomes Smug. Like what was the point of taking faces if she uses it once to kill an entire family (who knows if any of them are innocent) and never again.\n\nBeforehand she made sense and was a fun character who played off well with other characters, the show added Tywin and Arya stuff is a highlight, afterwards she's a complete mess and really being a character to me, which is a consistent issue in later series (looking at you robot Bran).
Blah blah blah yeah, if you were genuinely enthralled by Arya\u2019s beef with the Waif come in immediately for some brain testing, I feel like we could make huge breakthroughs in entertainment if we got a look inside your mind
Yeah, no, that's not how writing works. If you spend 6 seasons building up some supernatural existential threat, the catalyst for that threat becoming *an actual threat* can't be \"the main characters decide to not do nothing\". Had Jon *literally just fucking stayed dead*, then the Long Night either never happens or it happens in a way that uh...makes sense. That doesn't make his arc significant, it makes it pointless. No one has to unite, because the NK is a joke who can get murdered by some rando faceless man, and since the horn of winter doesn't exist in the show, he has no way past the wall without Jon going up there to begin with. If Jon does nothing or just stays dead, the arc doesn't happen. That's not to say you cant have the plot be about the protagonists cleaning up a mess they caused, and an antagonist they made/empowered/released, but that's not what happened. The WWs have been advertised as the real threat since the first episode of the first season. But they weren't. They were a nonfactor; the world didn't need to unite to beat them, as we see by Cersei sitting the entire thing out and only \"half\" of Dany's forces dying despite that, and that's *with the dragon the Walkers had that they wouldn't have had otherwise*.\n\nAlso thinking named characters dying means anything lmao. Hey guys, Lommy and mandon moore died! Oh no! They're named characters so that matters, right?\n\nThe Battle of Winterfell was narratively pointless, Dany is shown being able to demolish KL with *only* Drogon, the NK was never a real threat, no one important dies, I could go on forever.\n\nYou're the one reducing it to \"ur mad Jon didn't stab him\"\n\nNo, I'm mad he didn't destroy fucking anything despite being hyped up the entire show. Ramsay was more formidable than that chump lmao.
And if Ned hadn't told Cersei he knew about the incest, then he wouldn't have died and none of books 2-3 would have happened. And if Robb hadn't married Jeyne Poole/Talisa or sent Theon to the Iron Islands, the Red Wedding wouldn't have happened. Protagonists' mistakes causing their problems is a common trope in this story and in \"writing\" (lol at \"that's not how writing works,\" as if there's one guide to writing fiction that you just need to follow). \n\nNow, I agree that there are problems with the Beyond the Wall plotline. If the only way the night king gets beyond the wall is a dragon, and the only way he gets a dragon is by sheer dumb luck, that makes him a less interesting villain. I also wish more of the supernatural aspects and their fallout had been addressed before or after the battle.  I think The Long Night would have been more powerful of more characters died, and I wish many characters did more significant things in the episode itself, Jon included, to create more of a climactic feel. But let's not exaggerate. More characters do die in this episode than any other battle of the series, and among them are very significant characters like Jorah and Theon, not Lommie. The fallout from the battle affects the plot, driving Dany's rage and failed messiah complex, leading to the Bells. Jon is still the one who united half of Westeros and who gets credit (along with Arya) for winning the battle, causing Dany to feel more isolated and unloved in Westeros, leading \nto all that happens in the second half of the season. \n\nMeanwhile, claiming character arcs are pointless because a character doesn't destroy anything (in a glorious way, presumably? Because Jon does kill Dany) shows at least a massive oversimplification of what the term \"character arc\" means.
Yeah I straight up would have been more satisfied with Gendry. He was always somewhere on the list of possible contenders, while Bran was annoyingly out of nowhere.
tbh if they had a few more seems of him being explicitly heroic that could have been a VERY good twist.
I actually forgot about that. He sort of disappeared after that whole thing. These people should have been at least brought up.
He's even part Targaryen!
D&D kinda forgot about what they wrote in Episode 5
I feel like this has always been her story arc though. She always claims to be good and tries to do the right thing, but the second someone stands between her and her ambition she lashes out. Maybe it's me, but I feel like this is one thing that's always been in the series. The question if she's going to be as crazy as her ancestors or if she will rise above it.\n\nI mean, do you remember when she crucified the Masters? That was brutal and not exactly the only option available to her. She's always had that in her and this was a constant pattern within the series with Tyrion trying to temper her. I agree that this was a step further, but it didn't feel entirely out of character to me.
I apologize if it seems like I was trying to argue that it would not happen, I am trying to argue it was too fast. \n\nFor me, after hearing the bells, she should have taken off and destroyed the castle anyways. Which would be in character because of the brutality toward her enemies. Then once she has taken over, there is some unrest because of her destruction of the keep and the dothraki doing dothraki things. To stop the unrest she executes some civilians. Then more unrest. More executions. Until finally jon has to kill her. \n\nSomething that would really allow us to see that ultimate power push her over the edge. Instead of getting emotional on a dragon one day, torching a city and becoming hitler.\n\nIdk, that is just my opinion.
Objective means in my opinion right?
People are allowed to be fans of Hitler as well. It doesn't make what he did right.
>People are allowed to be fans of Hitler as well. \n\nI always knew there was something wrong about this place.  This sub has gone bonkers.
Didn't realise writing Game of Thrones was equivalent to genocide
Lady, I think you forgot your hormone pills.
To be fair they\u2019ll probably adapt one of the legend stories like knights of the old republic or something
Thats fucking lame, holy shit thats lame. People are expecting new stories not old rehashed ones.
Lmao I know right
That dialogue is too intelligent for current Tyrion.
That's also when they still had support of high garden and dorne as well \ud83e\udd14 good thinking on tyrion's part to save bloodshed...
Quick fix, Euron is Yara's (and Theon's) uncle.
And he got rewarded in the end.
I find this one of the most upsetting things. Danys downfall was tyrion stulid abd her blindly trusting him. You accept a few mistakes such as taking casterly rock wheb the army took highgarden however to have it done consistebtly by a character we know to be one of the most intelligent characters in the kingdom just to fit thw plot you lose the suspension of disbelief
she didn't have to.  just burn the keep.  or just sit there with the dragons intimidating as fuck, and watch everyone throw down their weapons and offer her cersei's head.
i don't think the keep housed just lannisters and she hadn't really demonstrated how powerful dragons are at that point. i do agree that it doesn't make a ton of sense and did say as much in my first comment but i just think the decision is kinda in line with dany's goals at the time.
Umm Dany doesn\u2019t even know about the NK till 7.06. In 7.01 there was literally zero reason she doesn\u2019t just show up at KL with her fucking laughably enormous army and three nuclear weapons.
So there are more than 2 situations here. She could still have taken King\u2019s Landing without burning all the women and children. After seeing the power that 1 dragon has then 3 dragons would be more than enough to win a war with the Lannister\u2019s. Just by intimidation if anything. Unless you think the only way to win a war is by killing everyone associated with the other side (total war) then she could have done that too. And she didn\u2019t think Cersei was going to help with the dead until the last episode of season 7. It had nothing to do with her motivations in the beginning of season 7
i mean i agree that it doesn't make sense considering how fucking strong drogon was in 8.05 but like i said, i don't think it's anywhere near the worst offender and not burning down the city or even the red keep is kinda in line with her motivations of taking the city without a loss of innocnet life as i'm pretty sure that even the red keep doesn't house just lannisters. honestly though i think a lot of people who write sci-fi or fantasy fuck up when they introduce some super powerful weapon that only one side has and then try to somehow portray it as a somewhat even fight.
The nightking having a dragon was fine. The dragon being his ticket to pass the wall was disapointing as hell ( but also predictible the moment he got the dragon)
[removed]
Like I said, grow up
I put 2 because the actors and realisation were good. But the writing is probably the shitest i ever saw.\nI spent half this last episode laughing in disbelief honeslty
Like I said if you factor in the rest of the show   and all the other impacts of this episode yeah I could believe someone giving it a 1.  Just like I can see someone who just wants to watch a big spectacle giving it a 10
I can honestly say there was no other episode of tv from other shows that I've seen that made me more disappointed or angry.  and most of this season has writing as bad as I've ever seen anywhere.
Then you don\u2019t watch enough TV....
They get more high fantasy as they go along. GRRM wanted to sorta do the opposite of Tolkien;instead of startibg with lots of magic and show it slowly fade away, he started low magic and slowly introduces more and more of it into the world.
magic is still negligible and mostly irrelevant, but most high fantasy centers around magic
The high fantasy elements really start up after book one with the birthing of dragons. Especially for characters in Essos. Still not as high fantasy as something like wheel of time.
sure. she's just the leader of a nation, she wouldn't know anything about something major like that.
Well Dany literally forgot a major part of her enemy's forces so nothing is out of the ordinary if Yara wasn't told Ayra killed the NK
Oh, but the NK wouldn't die in Winterfell if I had any say on it. I'd make them win the Battle of Winterfell, then the living keep retreating south all the way to King's Landing, where they make their last stand.
I mean they didn\u2019t even really have fight scenes early on. but now we have entire episodes dedicated to it. Like the battle where jamie got kidnapped.... they legit didn\u2019t even show it. they just showed what happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAPLiWPgLUQ\n\nThese are all better than anything we got in Season 8. Except for like dragon CGI stuff
Ugh even worse
The answer to your last line is they're tired of war.  If you want me to break it down how I interpreted it, I can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdmure- Riverlands.  He was a prisoner for years, was shut down by his niece when he was trying to nominate himself.  He lost the castle his uncle took, accepted his nephew's nomination.  Not really that objectionable for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSam- Reach.  He is best friends with Bran's brother.  He knows a bit about Bran's powers.  Thinks Bran might rule well with great knowledge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyrion- Westerlands.  Nominated Bran, obviously has great respect for him.  Thinks he will serve the realm well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGendry- Stormlands.  Newly appointed lord, presumably knows very little.  He loves the king's sister, has respect for his brother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRobin- Vale.  Yohn Royce gave him the look to agree.  Bran's cousin presumably on decent terms.  I'm unsure of how much Royce has filled him in, but he probably thinks Bran will be a fair ruler, as the Vale and North have been close since S6.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrince of Dorne.  I don't know about this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYara- Iron Islands.  She probably does not want Bran to be king.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDavos.  Holds the Stark family in high regard.  He's just looking for a fair and just ruler, no reason to think he doesn't think Bran will be that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome people might have enjoyed it, or wanted it, but we didn't need two more seasons of Gendry learning how to be a high lord.  We don't need to see the mess of a political situation that is Dorne, considering everyone very vocally hated it in S5.  With the rest, most are related to Bran, or hold his brother in high regard.  They have no reason to fight over this and potentially continue the war.  It's not a random northerner.  He is the last living son of Eddard Stark, warden of the north.  Prior to his death, Varys had been sending ravens all over.  We can assume he had relayed the events at Winterfell.  People know Bran's story.
i mean i hate to break it to you but you're not being clever at all, you're not actually arguing against anything i've said you're just screeching over my choice of words. shame you can't counter my point. i was hoping you'd ask how GoT is objectively bad but you still haven't.
Twice you accused people who liked this season as being borderline mentally challenged. You aren't arguing with any shred of integrity, so you certainly don't derserve my time or anything that isn't me throwing your insulting nonargument right back in your face.
OK...physically...
Well for one the 3ER is a spiritual entity that passes from host to host and is thousands of years old. It can also see the future, which is shown by the visions Bran has. It also basically took actions such as revealing jons heritage for no reason other than to cause kings landing to be massacred and himself to become king. There was no other result from that action. \n\nSo he's basically worse than Dany because he doesnt care about 1 million people being slaughtered while being completely sane, has total surveillance over everyone, and will be king for at least 1000 years in brans body, potentially forever if he swaps host and makes the new host king.
Yeah, I can see that. I think you got it right with the \"writing failed\" comment, though. I don't think we were supposed to take this grim analysis away from the show. I think painting it this way is just indicative of how much season 8 collapsed. And I think it's stuff like this that is making it difficult for George to finish the books himself.
Jon stops fucking Dany because of his lineage, that is the true problem it causes. The show unintentionally makes Dany not getting fucked by Jon anymore one of the biggest motivating factors of her madness. \n\nBut yea also nothing about Bran is acknowledged. He's the greatest war asset of all time and he does nothing to help. The fact that he gave the weapon that killed the Night King to the person that killed the Night King is certainly relevant.
I think it was more about her desperate loneliness than Jon himself. But I agree, they set up the scene as the specific moment that Dany\u2019s madness is locked into place. And the trigger is Jon\u2019s rejection of her advances. \n\nIt would have been cool if Dany\u2019s entire character arc wasn\u2019t derailed in a ten-seconds telenovela scene.
Bran sees the future in visions: he sees a dragon over kings landing; eventually that does happen and it turns out to be Drogon burning Kings Landing.
I understand why so many people are complaining, but it's typically the same reason across the board: \"it was rushed and things weren't explained.\" Sure, there were some dumb moments, but that's the main complaint.\n\nWith the few episodes they had, I think they did a great job and I'm fine with having to come up with some of my own ideas to fill in the blanks until the books come out.\n\nI like being left wondering a bit mixed with the relatively happy ending that we got.
[deleted]
Tyrion convincing anyone that Bran is the best King didn't make any sense at all. Elective Monarchy? Sure makes sense after the last two Heirs eliminated themself as candidates just now.  But why the youngest Stark who doesn't even speak?\n\nBtw where has Dorne been all the time and why are they now suddenly interested in who becomes King again? And why do they agree with Bran who they probably didn't even know existed.
Bran is totes a villain and people are just unable to accept it.
This has nothing to do with him being or not being able to see the future and manipulate events to change it.
Umm no you\u2019re arguing Bran merely lets things play out in a predetermined way. My argument is two-fold 1) This is barely alluded to whatsoever outside of two throw away lines. 2) If your argument is correct it is only correct because other characters have been made to act in outlandish and ridiculous ways
I thought the entire point of Hodor is their world isn't predetermined and could be changed and manipulated. There is something sinister about the way he asked Sam to tell truth and told that is the right time and also all the staring he had on Tyrion throughout the season.
I don't think the children can make the same mistake again.
Well, now that the knowledge of how WhiteWalkers are created is out there, this would be the set-up for a sequel series where some evil guy births a new Night King.\n\nOfcourse, I think Bran is the only one who knows so he'd have to have told Tyrion or somebody.
KL had mountains around it and it changed in the last seasons, you can't really use that as an evidence, they apparently have the technology to move around mountains in westeros.
It was literally the exact same mountain. There would simply not be a single reason to use the exact same mountain for different purposes. https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-579d1ac34cfc1b12153f8afa8f100fc6
It\u2019s all good, I can see how you read it that way
Yeah, but if it leaves people so confused its not a good ending. The execution also matters, not just the plot.
> I was able to make sense of It all and think It was a good ending\n\n.\n\n> Because a lot doesn\u2019t make sense..\n\nchoose one
Directly after watching It, I was very confused but then after thinking about It and taking into consideration the information from the books, I was able to connect the dots of how martin would finish the books with the ending from\nthe show. \n\nFor anyone who didn\u2019t read any of the books, they would never understand wtf happened this past season. Only with supporting info from the books can you kinda understand these characters motives and guess some things.
Lmao whatever. It was clearly meant as a bonding moment. Drogon was interested in jon and let him pet him. Then they showed dany intrigued at deogon doing that cause he never had before. You can tell it helped her her start loving jon the way she looked at him then. Cause she knew he was special for drogon to like him. Did you not even watch the scene lol.\n\nThen rhaegal bonded with jon by letting him ride him and pet him. How is a dragon letting you ride him not bonding lmao.\n\nSo there are at least three instances of dragons bonding with more than one person.\n\nYes i know what a strawman is. Its what you just did. i am solely talking about your comment regarding dragons bonding with only one rider which has been shown to be objectively false.\n\nI am well aware dragons have killed targaryens and of the civil war.
>then he wouldn't have died and none of books 2-3 would have happened\n\nUh, you sure about that buddy? I'm pretty sure Robert still dies, Joffrey still ascends, and Stannis still finds out he's the rightful heir. So uh...yeah no, the plot still happens. It definitely happens differently, but it still happens.\n\nThe plot doesn't happen if Jon just doesn't go north of the wall. We don't have to extrapolate with your example; we *know* Robert's death and Stannis taking up arms are independent of Ned's decision to tell Cersei he knows about the incest. But we *do* have to invent a way for the army of the dead to get beyond the wall, because the show never gives us one. They do it with Viserion. And Viserion remains their best weapon, since without him, only the NK himself and the...wind, are stopping all 3 dragons from just toasting everything even *if* they magically get over the wall and down to winterfell.\n\nSo uh, no. Also lol at the deaths. As for the fallout, you're right...sorta...but the fallout has nothing to do with a *battle*. As we see in episode 5, all of Dany;s setbacks were meaningless. Drogon can solo King's Landing. The end. None of the past 2 seasons affects her conquest in a meaningful way, and thus the WWs are reduced to a plot device to kill Jorah, while the rest of her woes with Cersei/Euron only happen to get Missandei killed, as together it robs her of advisors. *That's fucking it*. She can take KL with one dragon, which is what she should have done a season ago. Also, there's no justification for ep5 anyway, her turn towards genocidal Hitler comes out of nowhere, advisors or no, so if you're actually daft enough to try and defend that hilariously bad writing then you're a lost cause. As I've said a few other places, the fact that Anakin's turn to the dark side (which goes from conflicted but still on the side of the law to child murder in ~15m of screen time) is being cited as a heel turn executed *better* than Daenerys says everything about how much of an utter failure her transition to a morally black bad guy is.
> Which would be in character because of the brutality toward her enemies.\n\nHer enemies were the people of KL themselves, as she directly stated in dialogue that very episode. She knew from the moment word got out about Jon, that her fight to win the throne was no longer exclusively against Cersei. Removing Cersei was now only one obstacle. She knew she needed the rest of the country, the smallfolk and lords that would renounce support for her and stand behind Jon, to fear her completely. If she had only taken out military targets, it wouldn't send the same message. If the people hear of half a million burning alive in KL, they would be more inclined to hesitate in supporting a force against her, because she won't just destroy the army you send, she will burn you and your family down in your home.\n\n\nShe knew the battle needed to not just be won, but be won *a certain way*. She *needed* to take out Cersei *with maximum collateral damage* to send that message. She never thought a surrender would be sounded, so she would have a marketable excuse for why the battle \"had to continue\" until her enemy was defeated, and that she was willing to kill half a million to complete her objective, again, sending the message that noncombatants that don't support her aren't safe.\n\n\nWhen the bells were rung, she knew she would lose the throne then and there if the battle ended right away. Not a loss to Cersei, but a loss to the people of the 7 Kingdoms, who would rise against her and her inferior claim. She had to either give up right then and there on achieving the throne, or kill the people anyway to serve her ambition. The choice to serve her ambition to the detriment of others is one she has made numerous times in the past.
Her enemies were Cersei, Euron, The Mountain, The Golden Company, possibly Sansa, other Westeros lords and ladies that were against her. The people of Kings Landing were not.
What they did to the last season was pretty comparable, yeah.
3/10 troll, try harder
We\u2019ll see, the new trilogy was supposed to be new stories and look how that went lol
Exactly. The new trilogy began with a rehash of the fourth movie and the second movie in the trilogy was illogical and simply poor.
A lot of movie-goers won't be familiar with the books/video games and it would be the first time we would get to see it in a cinematic format.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are tons of films and television shows adapted from existing works including, of course, GoT so an adaptation isn't necessarily a bad thing.
If there is one thing D&D can do its adapt.

Ball washer? Wtf are you 12.... you\u2019re triggered and all I said was to grow up and respect others opinions that are different than yours, if you can\u2019t accept that I doubt you get far in life.\n\nSeriously grow up and get a life kid
Those aren\u2019t battles though. Like I said they had a few mini fight scenes but no battles. \n\nthat\u2019s your opinion that those scenes are better. they\u2019re good sure but idk about better choreography. that\u2019s just simply not what I was talking about , though
Yea, but I mean like ostensibly The Long Night was a battle episode, but there wasn't really any more fighting that that Syrio fight in Season 1, it's almost entirely just piles of wights on top of people who aren't dying for some reason. The Long Night was a battle for the fate of the world and its less engaging and less action than Tyrion's trial by combat in the Vale. I guess its just my opinion but ultimately my point is more fights/battles doesn't need to mean less drama/politics/intrigue/good writing
ok but you've still replied 3 times with nothing. why?
I explained why. You can't argue with integrity.
I dont know what GRRM has planned ofc, but honestly the 3ER being evil in the books wouldn't surprise me too much. It's actually a fairly popular book theory. After all, the 3ER is tied to the CotF, who were the original natives of Westeros that were invaded by humans and driven to near extinction. If the 3ER ends up taking over mankind it's like the ultimate revenge for them.
Just seems like not a very satisfying ending, even as a subversion of the genre like GRRM likes to do. All this just for an evil all-knowing dictator to take over? \"Mwahahaha - The End\" would not be a great ending to all of this.
Won't refer to season 8 writing other than telenovela from now on.
You're completely correct, and it sucks, but it is what it is and there's no option but to hate it because it's rushed, or just love it for what it is and what they did with it.
I choose the third option, be annoyed because it could have been so much better. A shitty ending to a great series.
It is in fact very transparent in the way Bran acts. He always stresses how things have to happen.
Except he really doesn\u2019t though. He literally never stresses any of that outside of \u201cyou were where you supposed to be\u201d and \u201cwhy do you think i came all this way\u201d. - Two lines, that\u2019s it...
Did he really change anything with Hodor though? He was the exact same throughout his entire life that Bran and most anyone else knew. He was always going to be affected by Bran meddling in the past, it just hadn't yet happened in the present. It's all predetermined.
I know, but GOT showed us that reasons do not matter. KL changed his position in the world, they used the same gate entry for KL and another city, it's just random.\n\nMaybe you're right, maybe the writers are, we just can't know that.
Well this one is actually obvious that it is true. The children of the forest were forced to flee to the north because of the first men moving in from the south. They made the NK for a last ditch effort to win the war.
God knows what Disney are doing with Star Wars tbh, the only think I\u2019m looking forward to is the madalorian show, everything else is just extra
Disney are doing the exact same thing D&D did with season 8: subverting expectations....\n\nPerhaps thats why they hired D&D
If you prefer Stan that works too
yeah I agree with you there but all I was saying is they steered in the direction of battles and flash visuals rather than the actual \u201cstory\u201d. \n\nI think we can both agree the 8th season is trash and it all went downhill after GRRM stopped getting involved/they strayed away from the books
and you've based that on one comment, despite me trying to open up the conversation after that? imagine assuming someone has no argument and then using that as your argument for not expressing your own argument. what an exercise in futility.
> and you've based that on one comment\n\nNo, you did it twice.\n\n> despite me trying to open up the conversation after that?\n\nAgain, why would I engage with you when you just call people mentally challenged for having a different opinion? I gave you an out to explain you exaggerated, but you doubled down. So, explained to me why I would engage in an argument with you about the show if you legitimately believe I'm mentally challenged for liking it. It's straight Ad hominem off the bat, bro. You cannot argue with integrity, so it's a waste of my time. You cannot be reasoned with.\n\n>  imagine assuming someone has no argument \n\nYou presented no argument. You just called people who liked this season borderline mentally challenged. Excuse me if I didn't assume you actually had one when I gave you an out and you, instead of presenting your argument, just doubled down on your insulting accusation.
The ending is the planned ending GRRM had...are you sure you don't mean the events leading up to it?
The ending is shaped by the events leading up to it. You cannot examine the ending without looking at how it came to pass.
Take any of Bran's dialogues in the previous episodes. He is always speaking of events as if they happen because they have to. What does he say to Theon? \"Everything you did brought you where you are now, where you belong.\"\n\nWhen he meets Jamie, he only acknowledges that Jamie pushing him led to him becoming the 3ER, again implying that everything had to happen the way it did. He also asks how does Jamie know that there is an afterwards, which once again establishes that he's not able to see the future, but he knows that there is really only one line of events that can take place.
And what is the point of Theon in that scene? Nothing...  \n\nAnd you haven\u2019t addressed my point that things only happen because characters do ridiculously out of character things. Also him causing Hodor literally establishes that if he wants, Bran can affect any timeline he pleases.
dude, the mountains were just outside KL would have you believed back then that some seasons after there would've been a desert just outside the city?\n\nI 100% agree with you, it's obvious, but they showed us they can subvert expectations. The show is over, we will never know.
Probably best to not compare season 8 with the other seasons. They rushed season 8 to the point that they had to change entire map layouts to make rushing easier.
>You presented no argument\n\ni said the last season is \"objectively\" bad. that is a statement of an argument.\n\n>Again, why would I engage with you \n\nyou're still replying lmfao. you've spent 10x the time not saying anything than you could have spent actually engaging with a discussion and presenting an opinion. is this what you do with everything in real life? just sit on the fence until you see one side being the most popular? do you have no real opinions for yourself? you just stutter and stall when someone asks you to explain your beliefs because they aren't really yours?
> i said the last season is \"objectively\" bad. that is a statement of an argument.\n\nSo, not an argument. Got it.\n\n>Again, why would I engage with you\n\n>>you're still replying lmfao.\n\n*Engage in an argument with you about the show*. Yea, I clearly explained this. You're not all that bright, are ya?\n\n>  you've spent 10x the time not saying anything than you could have spent actually engaging with a discussion and presenting an opinion.\n\nI don't do that with people who cannot argue with integrity. Talk about an exercise in futility.\n\n>  just sit on the fence until you see one side being the most popular?\n\nNo, I call out people for having insultingly ignorant positions, such as yourself. \n\n> do you have no real opinions for yourself? you just stutter and stall when someone asks you to explain your beliefs because they aren't really yours?\n\nI have lots of opinions. I've no reason to share them with you at the hopes of objective discourse, because you cannot do such a thing. You cannot argue with integrity. You just label people who disagree with you as being mentally challenged. You do not have an argument, just ad hominem attacks. \n\nAlso, lol @ your comment being removed. Hopefully that gives you the slightest clue about how inappropriate it is to say the things you've said.
Your argument that it only happens because of \"out of character\" things is invalid because it only works on the meta level. In the story itself characters can't act \"out of character\" because whatever they do IS their characteer.\n\nThe Hodor argument though is convincing imo.
5.5 yikes, really sums everything up, this season was shit
Keep in mind, the online backlash started with the Dorne storyline and how Stannis was written in season 5.\n\nThen season 7 had it's own set of problems with concerns like instant teleportation that was dismissed as \"nitpicking\". Took awhile but it finally bubbled up
I don't understand how people could dismiss the teleportation during the entire journey beyond the wall.\n\nApparently all this can happen within a day: Gendry can run back to the wall (since when are blacksmiths good runners?), send a raven, said raven flied to Dragonstone and Daenerys managed to fly north and also find them. All within a day (or less or more, we honestly don't know as time basically doesn't exist in the show anymore).
The IMDB scores are pretty rough too. The 6 episodes from Season 8 are in the lowest 6 spots in the overall episode ranking.
Have you seen the score on Rotten Tomatoes as well? Ouch!
It may not be the worst episode but it\u2019s significance in the story will always cause people to treat it more harshly. This is literally the episode that brings everything to a close, everything you have been hoping for over the past 8 years. \n\nBran becoming king was so left field and a nonsensical decision. It wasn\u2019t early and make the whole story feel empty.
I disagree, I think this really was the worst episode ever. It was a really terrible episode, the only ones that give it a run for its money were in this season.\n\nSeasons 1-4 were great, Seasons 5-6 were a drop-off in quality but we're talking a dropoff from a fantastic show to just a pretty good show. Season 7 was where it started to becoming really mediocre, but mediocre still isn't *awful.* And there aren't any episodes from seasons pre-S7 that specifically stand out to me as being bad on their own.
You liked the sand snakes confirmed
I agree, the journey beyond the wall is the stupidest and worst episode(s) in the entire show (and whichever the episode in which that Dorne girl said \"You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy\", fuck that episode.)\n\nFuck that episode was filled with teleportation, plot armor, plot convenience, and it was just a dumb mission from the beginning.\n\nLiterally all it did was to give the NK a dragon so that he could destroy the wall, that was the writers' purpose of that journey.
That \"Why do you think I came all this way?\" line *really* pissed people off.
Yes. For someone who doesn't \"want\", he showed particular arrogance about taking the throne. I would say he wanted it very much.
He picks when he wants to be a Stark and when he wants to be the raven at the plot\u2019s convenience.
As it should have. You can\u2019t just put in a sinister line like that, accompany it with upbeat triumphant music *and then never mention it again!*!  \n\nWe still know fuck all about Bran. When has wanting power or wanting the throne ever been a part of his character? When has he ever been shown to be a master manipulator of anything? (And no the dagger doesn\u2019t count, you can make that argument but it was never explicitly stated he had any other reason for giving it to Arya other than because he\u2019s a cripple). What was the point of his warging? What was the point of his time altering abilities? What was the point of him learning Jon\u2019s heritage? Aside from very very brief visions of what appears to be the sept explosion and Drogon flying over KL *nothing* else implied he knew the future and was manipulating events?  \n\nYou took a crippled boy with inexplicable powers, gave him an incredible journey which included arguably the shows most powerful scene (Hold the door), and then turned him into a pointless emotionless robot who\u2019s abilities or motivations are never explained in the slightest, and the sum of his contributions to the plot are being used as bait so the entire overarching plot of the show can be shanked out of existence by a teleporting teenage girl, and then being elected king for even more mind boggling reasons.  \n\nI mean pretty much none of the main characters had satisfying arcs in the end, but Bran was definitely the worst
Its so 2000's action movie ending line.
The 60 seconds later says to Tyrion that he doesnt want to be king.\n\nGet the fuck out of here you stupid prick. If you didnt want it why come all this way?..... and then no fucker pulls him up on that!!!!\n\n Fuck me the script was bad.
Bran is the true villain at the end of this series who got the Iron Throne by doing practically nothing and letting hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians die, it's infuriating
Yeah especially since this Lad had no I mentions of being king or a Lord
I dont fucking know. Cus your sisters rolled your ass all the way here while you stared blankly at people.
And then when he appoints Tyrion as hand and Tyrion says he doesn\u2019t want it, bran says \u201cand I don\u2019t want to be king\u201d. ??????????
well blame the show writers for not showing us when he revealed information to different people throughout the show. my favorite example was the ending of Littlefinger, based on everything we were shown up to the point we were led to believe LF was going to get his way, please tell me Arya didn't check with Bran to learn the truth. She recognized just what he could do the day they met under the tree.\n  \nIt simply can be put to down to he told who needed to know and only them but its not beneficial to the audience to know what is going to happen so we cannot be shown interactions with Bran for that reason. \n  \nthat last line is probably just par for the course with regards to writing quality
I liked it lol
Hes worse than Frodo at this point
> That \"Why do you think I came all this way?\" line really pissed people off.\n\nThat's something I dont get; I personally saw it as more of a \"I knew I had to become the king and so thats why I'm here\" not as a power craving \"yes I came because I wanted to be king\" kind of line. Maybe I'm the one that's wrong though but to me it makes a lot more sense, especially with the \"upbeat triumphant\" music.\n\nI've also assumed from the start that the 3ER is not evil and just does what he's supposed to do, with no hidden motives, so maybe that's also why I assumed it was a positive line.
Worst Line and scene of the whole show.
Well I mean, it speaks for itself
It was an insanely stupid line, considering like two episodes ago he said he couldn\u2019t be lord of anything. The writers must really think the audience was dumb.
when I read the leaks, I was shocked, he was the last on my list to get the Iron Throne. I thought it'd be Gendry because he got legitimized, and surely there must be an actual reason for that other then Daenerys gaining more loyal soldiers. But then I thought, there hasn't really been any build-up whatsoever indicating Gendry with leadership skills so he can't be the king. Neither can Tyrion, it'd be hella awkward if that happened. But for Bran to be the chosen one, never in a million years would I thought him as a candidate lmao.
Tyrion being left out of the story was the worst of the worst for me. Literally makes no sense.
The thing is, he had the potential to be the most interesting. Instead of wasting so much time with his story we could have spent it getting to know him and his powers. Is the 3ER good? Does he still feel? What does he want? How do his powers work? Why does he act the way he does? Doing so could have made the White Walkers more interesting too.\n\nThe problem is he ended up being a dull and poorly explained character. Him taking the throne could have been interesting, but it just ended up seeming stupid. I wonder if the showrunners only found out he was king later on and mistakenly downplayed his arc.
I just don\u2019t understand why the OG 3ER had so much more emotional scale than Bran did once he became the 3ER. Fucking robot.
I agree. Although even if they found out later about Bran being king they honestly could have cut out the Brienne/Jamie, Arya/Gendry, Bronn/Tyrion scenes and given us a couple 3ER scenes, or just added a few more minutes. Not that I have an issue with any of these scenes, I just don't understand why they'd add these subplots that are relatively unimportant to the story when, clearly, there was something extremely important about the 3ER. There's actually a lot more about the 3ER in the books so it's not like they didn't have extra material to work with.

Who was the first King of Seven (sorry Six) Kingdoms to be selected by popular vote.   Damn this script.  Damn it all to hell.
What did you expect? He did literally nothing significant entire series and then he's being crowned as king lmao.
He never did anything and for whatever reason he got the throne... Hell, Three Eyed Raven and didn't do anything special except being stoned and flying around with a raven and killing Hodor...
No, he's just the least people's favourite. For all you know he could be everyone's 2nd best.
Really. Bran.
Fewest*
:|
He absolutely 100% was the least popular before the final episode, aside from Rickon who was just a footnote. I don't know anybody who was particularly interested in or cared about Bran at all. On top of that, we don't know dick about his powers, really, and they were never particularly useful in any way, despite the show spending plenty of time on him.\n\nI think the last episode pissed people off enough that they voted Rickon over him just out of spite.
He's the new Joffrey.
[https://twitter.com/vornietom/status/1130522571210838016?s=20](https://twitter.com/vornietom/status/1130522571210838016?s=20)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis person gave a wicked Bran theory that makes him a lot more exciting.
Everyone's seen that theory, and it was made a before that person rambled on it. Was on ASOIAF after Episode 3.
He was an odd choice... no leadership experience and no charisma
Because his character serves zero purpose to the show than to utter dumb bullshit and state off into the distance.
Well that's because they turned him into a creepy, almost inanimate part of the set for the past two seasons. What made GoT great was its dynamic characters and complicated plot, which he was not only left out of most of the end of the series, but also apart from for most of the middle. His story was always tangential, then non-existent, then they made him king. What?!
How dare you say that about our king!
Forget Rickon, even Dickon is more popular than Bran
Rickard.
Ser Pounce is more popular than Bran
Everyone likes a good Dickon :)
It's still called seven kingdoms. I think.
They said Lord of the Six Kingdoms multiple times
Dude you spelled vagetreble wrong
Vegeterrible*
Vegemite
They didn't bother to even try and bring Catelyn back either as the one ghost character
Unpopular opinion. But I think Bran is great. Even better in the books.
Protest vote? I can only read it as someone saying \u201cI don\u2019t like any Stark in the show\u201d
This is an insult to my boy Ned, who died long before his character could be ruined.
Nailed it. The other Starks turned into caricatures of themselves.
1. Most people weren't terribly interested in Bran before he went all 3ER\n\n2. When he went 3ER, he lost literally all of his personality and he became one of the least interesting characters to watch on the show.\n\n3. Bran getting his powers ate up a lot of screen time and was, in the end, almost entirely pointless - which was already making people like him less and less as the series closed out, but then the \"Bran is king now because why not\" twist at the end pissed off enough people that they probably voted Rickon just out of spite.\n\nRegarding Catelyn: I think it's just that most people would vote other Starks (who are still alive) over her, and there are also probably fans who started watching later on and may have missed her entirely. Ned, conversely, was a fan-favorite character in the short term he was around, got a LOT of screen time then, and he's also probably the vote for people who want to express \"I preferred the old show.\"
Just wait until Grrm finishes Winds. Rickon will bring Unicorns to Westeros and fucks Ramsay's army.
Shaggy dog was pretty bad ass so it's a package vote I suppose
The same way ghost is so loved. Characters that D&D just forgot about for seasons at a time
I think because everyone hates Bran *that* much they probably chose Rickon out of spite, which I can\u2019t say I blame them .
> While I'm not exactly surprised that Bran is the least favorite, how the hell did Rickon get so many votes? He was the most useless Stark of them all.\n\nI liked Rickon in the books and show. \n\n A lot of the child characters got aged up significantly for their roles in the show and go on to do a lot within the story and travel the kingdoms, meeting different people (as high lords would). \n\n Rickon is just a child who has (hasn't?) grown up as he witnessed his father leave, all of his brothers leave (Not sure how he viewed Jon) and got stuck in Winterfell with his crippled older brother and Theon. \n\n He was the innocent character who just wanted a normal life and couldn't really comprehend everything that was happening and just wanted to be with his older brother (Bran) and to grow up.
> Catelyn should have beaten him at least \n\n&#x200B;\n\n My brain glitched and took this as: If Catelyn had beaten up her son, he would've been less useless.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(Whelp, guess who's getting sterilized. /s)
I was pretty disappointed that her ability to steal faces never came into play again. Just like a lot of things it leaves you wondering \u201cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201d
Poor writing; and two folks who probably wanting to go play Star Wars. How'd they take how many years between seasons to fuck not only the cast and show over, but the writing and fans. HBO should never be given the reigns of something lile this. HBO; we know how to write 4 good seasons of a series; then we just don't know\"
Hey, she is badass.  That is how she recognized that a genocidal lunatic was a killer.
\"I know a killer when I see one\"\n\nPeople who torch entire cities tend to be killers yes....\n\nGreat observation
\"Woah now Arya, I'm just supposed to take your word for that?  I'm going to need at *least* a 20 page paper with citations.\"
after being ok with her brother bending the knee to the very same person.
People eat that shit like burrito.
But people eat that shit up.  That's the exact kind of lame that spawns Twitter worship.
I agree. The \"I might die, I like a boy, boink boink boink, all night long\" facade was pretty tiring too.
What? She was scared or crying on screen for half the season?\n\nPlus, the question asked who was your favorite Stark overall not your favorite Stark in a poorly written season.\n\nIt's not surprising when you consider: \n\n1. Tywin/Arya scenes are some of the best in the entire series \n\n2. Arya/The Hound is the best pairing in the show and their scenes are also amongst the best\n\n3. Maisie gave the best performance of all of the Stark kids in the better seasons and was the only one amongst them to get an Emmy nomination. \n\n4. I don't think Arya has a single boring moment in her arc from season 1 through her arrival in Braavos(Harrenhall, list of names, Yoren, The Brotherhood, The Hound, Tywin; etc. is brilliant). \n\n5. The Frey Massacre  is an excellent fan service moment \n\nI didn't like the way she was written in season 7 and season 8 was only slightly better but she'll always be my favorite Stark on the strength of seasons 1-4 alone.
What? She was still fucking great. Especially when she killed the Night King. She saved the fucking world.
Yeah Cat is the most underrated character, maybe in anything. The most well acted, super complex with a mix of flaws and great/badass/emotional traits, just an all around fantastic character.
Yeah, if you take Cat out of the show, the whole thing kind of falls apart
You have to admit, she was kind of a bitch...
Yeah and dany was insane, Jon was stupid, Geoffrey cruel, Tommen weak, Tywin ruthless.  Each characters qualities whether they be likable or not contributed to this amazing story. So I admire them all the same, what\u2019s there to admire about rickon? Kid came up with the by far worst name for his wolf and didn\u2019t know how to zig zag he made absolutely no contribution to the story.
As a person or a character ? I didn\u2019t love her but I as a lot of respect for her.
I agree - the wight hunt was completely pointless in retrospect. Cersei didn't send any of her forces, and they easily won even without her help. Thoros and Benjen died for absolutely nothing.
It was pretty pointless at the time, not just retrospect. What about Cersei made it seems like she would be convinced? It was pretty clear that the writers knew they wanted the NK to have a dragon and had to reverse engineer a plot to make that happen. And thus Dumb Plan (TM) was born.
It would have made a hell of a lot more sense if they planned on leading the wight through the streets of King\u2019s Landing, helping Dany to look like the protector of the people. \n\nCersei could then send her army north, but only so far as the Neck to stop the Northern Coalition from coming south. History repeats itself but in reverse when it becomes clear that the Neck can\u2019t hold against dragons - Cersei and the Lannister army retreat to King\u2019s Landing and the Golden Company gets wiped out at the Neck. \n\nThen they don\u2019t have to change too much from the general trajectory of the plot other than covering up stupid mistakes (like Dany forgetting about the Iron Fleet). It would have made a neat dichotomy between Dany coming to King\u2019s Landing as the protector of life and then coming to the city as the harbinger of death. \n\nAgain, I think that a lot of problems this season come down to the fact that too much was crammed in in too few episodes and seasons. Let Dany\u2019s desire to be feared rather than loved take up more than 30 minutes of screen time. Make Tyrion\u2019s desperate desire to be loved and accepted by his sister, and guilt over killing Tywin, serve as his justification for trusting Cersei so much. Just give the audience and the characters time to breath and act like real people.
Easily won? Only if you know you have plot armor. Hopefully the characters aren't aware of the existence of D&D
I get we needed more time for the turn of Dany; but damn. They wasted 1 full episodes on pointless grobble in episode 1. The army of the dead can move stupid fast in battle. Yet they march super slow?
That episode sucked after the ending lol.
> completely pointless\n\n\nI agree, but an argument can be made that the wight hunt convinced Dany that the NK & AotD needed to be defeated.
It's called bad writing. I will never recommend this show to anyone because every storyline gets thrown out the window for big budget and looks in S8. Entire show ruined in 6 episodes they should at least get an award for that.
I mean, just because it didn't work doesn't mean it was the wrong decision. They needed ALL the help they can get. This was their only hope of getting her to fight with them. It didn't work. Sometimes you gotta take risks.
It convinced Jamie to go north.  His presence clearly motivated Brienne.   \n\nWithout Jamie,   Winter fell is overrun quicker, and The Night King kills Bran before Arya can Air Jordan.
Realistically they should have just asked Cersei for a truce so that everyone could complete final preparations for winter. Both sides have been devestated by war,  the wagon train raid showed that King's landing was at real risk of being starved out. EDIT not saying that would have worked either, but it would have been a lot easier than some crazy raid to capture a white.
Don\u2019t forget Viscerion
Man, if Emilia Clarke was my aunt, you wouldn't even have to ask me twice.
So, it is all about cocks in the end as Jaime admits in S7E1
Dumbest story of the series..still ridiculous how that episode got good ratings and reviews
It was much more ridiculous than anything this season
 \"not taking one for the team and fucking his aunt\" lmfao
It depends. Do we judge a decision by the information available to the characters at the time, or with full hindsight? Some good decisions turn out horribly...
Not only was it a bad decision in the show, it was also a terrible decision by the writers. S07E05 is precisely the episode where the whole show goes to shit and never recovers.
Even someone with half a brain would have realized that Cersei has no reason to help, even if the WW are real. And when you think that the one that came up with this plan was Tyrion, the one tormented by Cersei from his birth (according to Oberyn) and who was presented since the beginning as a very smart character that also knew what kind of person Cersei is, is even more mind-boggling.
Telling Jon who his parents are has to be up there.
And then the dead dragon was hyped up in the finale of season 7 and then it really did nothing after that.  What a damn let down so many of these plots were\n\nIt was such a stupid plan and stupid writing I thought the only logical thing (at first) was Tyrion was manipulating them somehow for the good of his own house.  Now I realize it\u2019s just shitty writing
You didn\u2019t even need hindsight to know it was the worst decision. The wights aren\u2019t smart. Set a trap, come back in the morning. Boom! Got yourself a scary dead guy! Or maybe send more than like 6 guys to get em.
Catelyn arresting Tyrion wins.
What a dumb bitch, that one. She did not deserve my man Ned.
So the conclusion was that the D makes the world spin? :P
Worst thing about that wight hunt is they could have easily just not burnt the next dead watchman or something. No need to have a whole big storyline about it.
Idk planning to put a huge proportion of the living army into an unarmed cavalry charge is mighty dumb. At least there was reasoning with Beyond the Wall.
All she wanted was the D and he didn\u2019t deliver. Moral of the story: Satisfy your woman and she won\u2019t go out and kill a million people.
Note: wight hunt only exists to extend the final season into two smaller seasons. \n\nFor an addendum to the close second, can we add not giving any dialogue to Jon for  exposition on his feelings (or lack thereof?) for Dany? Totally unclear to me whether he lover her or not... or maybe that's the intent? Dany: \"Jon loves me, Jon loves me not, Jon loves me, Jon loves me not...???\"
I dunno. Tywin not locking the toilet door behind him was a pretty bad mistake.
Plus Jon Snow himself goes on this daring, wacky mission. Yeah it puts a character in there everyone cares more about so there's dramatic tension, but that's pretty pointless to have him in the party logically.
This will happen  \ud83d\udc4d
You rock!
Maybe make a post where you take some suggestions for different questions / answers?
You\u2019re the best!
Also, one question should be \"Do you think S8 made the previous seasons less interesting for you?\"\n\nPlus, at \"Who was the most interesting villain?\" you should clearly add Bran :P
Top draw.
I can't wait.
Well he could just, you know, return to Winterfell. There's nothing really forcing him to go North after Greyworm leaves. Even his \"exile\" makes no sense.
Actually shouldn't he be able to? Sansa doesn't bend the knee to Bran so Winterfell can do whatever the hell they want.
Does he even want to return to Winterfell? He and Sansa never seemed particularly close in the show, and that was before she betrayed his trust.\n\nAlso, without White Walkers the North isn't quite as horrible a place to live. The final shots even suggested it was starting to thaw.\n\nBeing a wildling might not be so bad, all things considered.
Yeah he loved being a wildling in the early seasons
I was one of the people who said Jon the Just. I thought I was clever. Apparently not.
>ttyl\n\nExcept not because they\u2019ll be too busy ruining Star Wars.
That's already been done.
Probably that describes the notes GRRM gave them...
No shit, their job as writers was to fill in the gaps and create a compelling story that achieved the bullet points given by GRRM. They failed spectacularly.
It's clear the writers just wanted to be done with the show and move on to other projects. That's the only explanation I have for this cluster fuck.
that's not a scoop, it is known
I think it was more that he was weird and I never cared about his story and then some how he magically became the most important person in Westeros for the dumbest reason in the dumbest way. Plus the other Starks were more entertaining and had better stories/arcs
See I found Brans's story line to be the most mysterious & intriguing throughout the entire show, but yeah they ended it horribly.
Rickon?
bUt hE hAs ThE bEsT sToRy ThOuGh
Even before becoming the 3ER i feel his story line was always the least talked about, it just felt so disconnected from everything else and his characters was always kind of boring, the only likeable things in his arc were Hodor and Summer.
Don\u2019t forget about Jojen and my girl Meera. I liked them when they were around.
Bran's storyline was one of my favorites before the whole Hodor climax. It had a fun supporting cast in Osha, the Reeds and Hodor, and the mystery of what the White Walkers are and what his visions mean was interesting. It's just the conclusion that sucked.
I haven't known anybody who ever really gave a shit about Bran. He was more popular than Rickon, but only because Rickon barely existed. They spent so much time on Bran, he became the 3ER and lost literally all of his personality, and in the end him becoming the 3ER ultimately just felt kind of pointless anyway. Rickon beating him out was just a spite vote I think, but if you removed Rickon from the poll he would have been last no matter what at any point.
That wad the main problem of GoT - the storylines werent connected. This also led to the biggest disappointment with the almost meaningless battle for Winterfell and the death of the NK. \nAnd all they did to connect the two plots was making Bran the king?
Not to mention completely stupid and illogical.\n\n\"I'm not Brandon Stark anymore\"\n\n\"I'm the Three-Eyed Raven\"\n\n\"I'm no one\"\n\nThen in S8E6\n\n\"Bran the Broken!\"\n\nLike wtf.

>\"I'm no-one.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeason 5 No-Show Bran trained with Faceless Men confirmed.
> It just felt so forced\n\nYup. I don't ever recall seeing him transition from normal Bran in training to emotionless Bran. One seen he is normal, the next scene we see him he is emotionless. No transition, no clear or well illustrated reason, just forced.
Yeah, I think D&D went for unpredictability for the sake of unpredictability. No one predicted Bran because no one thought such an inane character would be picked as king. But D&D didn't realize unpredictability alone doesn't make a good story.
I think the intention was to make him like a puppet figure and have the real power be those who rule on the board, so nobody is actually truly with sole power. But even then, still weird.
I had to vote him because I thought back and realized how much I liked his character. I loved that he was filling the role his father left and marching to war to save his father
He got rated behind Sansa... WTF?\n\nPeople need to go back and rewatch seasons 1-4. Before the show's writing took a turn.\n\nRobb's story came to a tragic end yes, but his character, his flaws, and his greatest mistakes were all beautifully written.
I'd argue Robb suffers from being to similar to Ned. I chose Ned but Robb would've likely been #2(possibly Jon).
Amen.
There's not going to be any spinoffs based on this era of GoT.
I can easily see them doing a spinoff with older Arya, especially if the prequels go well. Casuals will love the idea and HBO will make bank.
No spinoffs for the main cast or anyone from this timeline.
Maybe there\u2019s like a weird limbo of nothing-ness if you die but are meant to be brought back to life? Definitely would have had some plot conflicts but plot didn\u2019t matter much in the 8th season anyway
Also, a lot of the storylines of the Starks were influenced by Ned and his teachings to his children. He let Arya start training, set Sansa up with her \"dream guy\", taught Jon and Robb about integrity and honor.
Agree. I feel like the true overall winner of the GOT is ned. You canclearly see his philosphy and actions ripple through the rest of the story ajd characters whilst tywins on the other hand led to the demise of most of his family other than tyrion who killed him.
Very true.
Were people counting the young Ned flashback scenes when they voted? They're brief but I didn't even think about that. I was only thinking of Sean Bean's portrayal.
Seen Been is that dude
He played Ted Snark
he is a lovely human Bean
I always thought him throttling LF was kind of a dick move, but overall he was cool. Earned my vote.\r\rHis speech when he's talking with Varys in the dungeon is one of my favorite scenes in the show.\r\r> You think my life is some precious thing to me? That I would trade my honor for a few more years of... Of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and learnt it well. I grew up with soldiers. I learned how to die a long time ago...\r\rChills. So good. Also kind of meta in that it's Sean Bean delivering it lol.
It\u2019s an interesting motivation for why he refused to let go of his honour. But what about his children? Was he fine that they would be left alone in Kings Landing with no one else to care for them? That was incredibly selfish what Ned did in hindsight.
When I saw that combination, I thought that would be the least likely to happen considering that Jon will not leave the north anytime soon and Arya will definitely stay as far away from the freezing cold as possible
It won't be freezing cold, grass was starting to grow, you could see a sprouting plant when Jons walking North
Everyone will meet everyone again except Arya who will never return imo.
I mean she will just end up in Essos. It's well established in the lore that the world of Asoiaf is round, and that if you go west of westeros you end up in Essos.
I thought the same about Arya (only that she would die because she didn't find land), however I was left with a feeling that none of the other would meet again at all. Though Sansa may travel north and surprise me and Jon or if she were to go to KL because of some obligatory event\n\nIt only felt like Jon and Arya were close-knit too me
I don't think people went by logic, but by the feel the series left them with. To be honest, a lot of stuff in this season (way too many) were illogical at best.
Indeed. I hate the excuse that \"This is a fantasy series with dragons and magic, it doesn't have to make perfect sense!\" Even in a fantasy setting, a story still needs to adhere to basic internal rules, such as the laws of physics, logic, common sense, and consistency with the story's *own established lore and character development.* \"Suspension of disbelief\" isn't limited to just imaginary creatures.\n\nAt the very least, seasons 7 and 8 needed to be full, 10-episode seasons to give the story room to breathe. Ideally, it should have gone on for 9 full seasons, and with D&D replaced as writers if they made it clear they weren't willing to put in the effort anymore.
there was too much fan service in this season and it really wrecked timing and how scenes played out by the end. Instead of missing pieces of the story we got fan service scenes and that did not benefit anyone
Maybe the North is what's west of Westeros.
It would be funny if Arya has every intention of seeing Jon again but didn't want Sansa or Bran to know she was planning on coming back to westeros to visit.
We've seen people teleporting all over the place, distance is not a hindrance in Westeros
They hatin' on my boy Tyrion by not giving him a redhead dreamy queen. They even hinted at getting their marriage back on track during the battle of Winterfell
Bran and Jon are the second most likely to meet besides Bran and Sansa, the others have like, zero chance IMO. Arya is gone for good, flat out. Even if she doesn't die a horrific death like she would in the books for trying to sail west, there's no way she'd ever come back or make the journey back. \n\nJon is going north and has zero reason to go back south, the only person he might ever interact with is Bran, if Bran retires and also returns to beyond the wall to live in a tree again. \n\nSansa will likely meet with Bran for diplomatic stuff and maybe visits, but she'd never go beyond the wall or out to see
I voted for Bran and Jon as one of the more likely ones in case they find out something else about the White Walkers and Children.
Yeah they did. They fought against the Greyjoys together. I believe Rob said it had been 9 years or something like that since they'd seen each other; Robert's rebellion ended 17 years prior.
To be fair though, that was back when Westeros was much larger, a trip from Winterfell to Kings Landing took quite a while. Westeros has gotten much smaller, it's like less than a day trip to get to Kings Landing apparently
Oh yeah! Still only once in 17ish years though, and Bran and Sansa wouldn't travel to fight in rebellions.
YOU'RE THE KING'S HAND! YOU'LL DO AS I COMMAND, OR I'LL FIND ME A HAND WHO WILL!
I think Sansa and Jon will have the best chance to happen considering that they're not that far away from each other
I get the feeling both really don't like each other. Sansa basically spent three seasons undermining Jon and ended up with his title at the end of it.
Politics and cooperation would bring them together though.
Bran is an evil, smug little shit with the voice of somebody from Hull.
I've been saying for 5 days now that while there are legitimate gripes with this season (the pacing), like 90% of the whinging is contrived circlejerk from people who just weren't paying enough attention to get through the (unfortunately) faster pacing.\n\nExhibit A.
This really is the correct answer because:\n\n* Arya and Jon are the 2 Starks that the majority of everyone cares about\n* The relationship between Arya and Jon is one of the most popular relationships on the series and even their reunion was the most anticipated reunion for Season 8 so people just like thinking of them together and hanging out
I'm one of those who voted for Jon+arya as most likely reunion and don't see my reasons listed in these comments so will explain myself.\n\nFirst let's get suspicions of positive bias out of the way: I don't really like any of the starks that ended up alive, found them all annoying for various reasons (i did like jon and arya at one point but grew sick of them in later seasons), so it's not about me being fans of those characters and being hyped about reunions. If you had to twist my arm and force me to name a fav stark of the survivors it would be Sansa who I used to despise but ended up neutral towards her because her cattiness made me lol and her evolution into a grown up mean girl made sense, only stark that wasn't ruined in my eyes. \n\nSo why did I say I believed Jon and Arya are most likely to meet up one day? Because they are the only ones who actually like each other enough to go through the trials necessary to find each other. For all the talk about the Starks being a pack, I honestly felt they didn't care much about each other at the end.\n\n\\-Bran Stark: isn't likely to travel from KL and view him as a hands off king who will spend his time warging and giving cryptic advice whilst letting the council do the heavy lifting, occasionally indulging in 4d chess moves. I don't see him becoming nostalgic for his family or even caring much for anything anymore so the odds of him visiting any of the others is remote. If he does want to see his family, he will just warg and spy on them and be done with it and i'd hardly call that a reunion especially when the other party doesn't even know he is there.\n\n\\-Sansa: doesn't actually like any of her surviving siblings, tolerates them at best. And she is queen of her own kingdom now so will be plenty busy managing her affairs and continuing the stark line (once she has kids she will have even less inclination to travel north to visit jon, who again, she doesnt care for that much to begin with, so they could be close together geographically speaking or on opposite sides of the world, it's not likely to happen). Any contact she will have with bran will be via intermediaries and ambassadors, it is unlikely Sansa will ever travel south again and Bran won't be going north either as explained above.\n\nJon: Is actually the most sociable of the surviving starks which kind of says it all...And the dude is so ned like that he won't break his oath and will stay in the north, so won't be visiting sansa even if he really wanted to.\n\nAnd being with the wildlings he might be hard to find, I just don't see queen sansa mucking around in the untamed north risking herself to find jon for a friendly chat.\n\nWhich leaves me to...\n\nArya: Yes she is last seen sailing away, but unless she dies at sea (and she is such a fan favorite i'd find that end a bit anti climactic, though perfectly in line with what GoT used to be) then chances are ONE day, even if its in 40 years time, Arya will come back to westeros even if its for a short nostalgia stay.\n\nAnd which of the starks would she go see? Jon of course, they are the only 2 to have a bond that might endure the test of time.\n\nAnd unlike Sansa, I can actually picture a seasoned Arya being able to trek across the north to find Jon wherever he might be. If she survived her boat ride, that should be ez pz.\n\nAnd that is why I voted Arya+Jon most likely reunion over sansa+jon (who are not even that \"close\" btw, the north is huge and jon isn't likely to have a fixed address that makes finding him easy) or sansa+bran (they have 0 desire to meet and neither would want to move from their respective kingdoms). That was my tldr of the day!
Very well said!

Confirmed, there were TWO that said that
Kings Landing was an inside job. Bran knew about it before it happened. Dragon fire cannot melt steel beams.
I like your thinking. This even fits with that useless white horse at the end of Episode 5.
Yea it was pretty stupid how the last scene of E5 is Arya leaving on the white horse, and then her first scene in E6, she's still in the city, but on foot, and the horse is never seen again. Wtf was the point?
[deleted]
\\>Only one thought in mind\n\nHey, he was also thinking about fucking the queen.
Maybe that was by the by. 88% of people agreed that he knew Kongs Landing (thanks to op who first wrote the typo) would burn. If he knew it, why not try to stop it? Maybe don\u2019t tell Jon about his parents?
Its sort of like Dr Strange, but evil.
/u/Grochen
[deleted]
Neither option is in any way established in the series.
Do you watch Marvel movies? I'm trying to be vague in case you don't. They are referencing that.
After reading someone else accidentally calling it Kongs Landing I can\u2019t help but refer to it that way now.
I think you\u2019ve hit the perfect episode.
I'm so glad people keep making this typo.
I'm telling you, if the show ended with a scene of Jon finding a WW spiral and a shot of just Bran the show would have a VERY different story
Yes! That\u2019s what I think! I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s what the writers intended, let\u2019s face it probably not, but it\u2019s right there in the script!
I dont think that says he's evil at all. He might either be 1. neutral and just goes with the literal flow (of time), and does what he SHOULD do based on what he's seen, or 2. he's a good guy and alternates the future for the best result. Yeah a million people died, but maybe that was actually the lesser of two (or a thousand) evils, and that's why he \"let it happen\".\n\nOf course, yes, maybe he IS evil, but I feel like it would make a lot less sense if he was evil imo.
Deciding that a million people should die to ensure a better future is exactly what caused everyone to say Dany was mad, and for her to be killed.\n\nSo why is it different when Bran does it? Because he knows for sure?\n\nIt\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a good answer.
Well, we never know.
A more positive interpretation is that he recognized that without him there as a compromise candidate, that meeting would have ended in another war.
Is it possible Bran was just referring to the wheelchair bound month long journey it takes to get to KL from WF? Surely he went down south knowing they would have to determine a king or queen and that\u2019s what he could have meant by that. I\u2019m not entirely sure Bran is completely all knowing. I mean I won\u2019t deny he knows who will play important roles in future events and what not but are we really going to say Bran knows everything that is ever going to happen in the future?
I really can't see travel time being referenced by the writers of beyond the wall and Teleporto-pirate...
Well of course, I just prefer the Bran as villain-take on it
I have to admit a while ago someone else accidentally wrote Kongs Landing and it really made me laugh. I can\u2019t help but refer to it as Kongs Landing now.
Even in conversation now I can\u2019t help but refer to it as Kongs Landing. Someone mentioned Cersei Lannister throwing barrels out of the red keep and it\u2019s an image I can\u2019t get out of my mind!
If that's the case, then the writing was still terrible. If the 3ER had some sinister plan all along to take the throne then they should at least have explained who he was
I agree it should have been explained which is why I\u2019m hopeful it will be explained in a prequel. I hate thinking they would take advantage of the viewer by leaving us with this hole, but the only explanation I can think of is they are saving that story. Otherwise, it is just crappy writing. \nThe only positive thing I can think of about leaving it unexplained is it allows the viewer to create their own story and fans to supply some amazing fan fiction/theories. Now that it\u2019s ended I will miss reading all the theories on this subreddit. It added an element to the show that I really enjoyed and isn\u2019t common among most shows. But that isn\u2019t for everyone so I understand the disappointment many have.
Where has it ever been said that the 3ER has the ability of seeing possible future outcomes?
I don\u2019t think it has,  but he has seen flashes of future events. When he was north of the wall searching for the 3ER he had a vision that showed a dragons shadow flying above KL and I believe in another vision he saw the Sept of Baelor explode before it happened. The 3ER really never been fully explained. So I am in error I do not know he sees all possibly outcomes. That was a far stretch on my part.  He would be able to see the past though which would have helped him decide that a Brandon was the right choice. That is only if the previous 3ER already knew of Jon\u2019s heritage. Did all the previous 3ER memories transfer to Bran? I guess if we knew that maybe we could understand the 3ER motives more?
Who said that Bran isn't Bran any more? Bran.\n\nWho then said \"Yes I am totally Bran, King Bran* actually?\" Bran.\n\nYou're taking one thing that he said as gospel while ignoring his later decisions. I can see why you'd do that, because Bran/the show as written doesn't make any sense and we're trying to make sense of it, but that's not what it is.
You\u2019re right I am taking one thing he said and making it gospel,  but I\u2019m also looking at his behavior. It really does seem after he became the 3ER that Bran does not exist anymore. For me I see Brandon Stark and Bran/3ER as different characters. There seems so little of Bran left after he became the 3ER. Unfortunately, it\u2019s left to the viewer to try and figure it out because it wasn\u2019t given time to be explained.  At least it gives us fan theories to read, but it does leave us feeling unsatisfied.
Those responses could have been the 3ER lying.
I didn't interpret it like that. He's still Bran, just not the Bran everyone knew. He's the Three Eyed Raven, but hes still \"Bran Stark\". Like...think of it in the sense that Sansa season 8 is NOT Sansa season 1. Then exemplify that by like a thousand. That's how I thought of Bran when he told people like Meera that he wasn't \"Bran\".
Yeah I think it\u2019s probably a flaw in the writing, but nevertheless it\u2019s there in the script. \u201cWhy do you think I came all this way?\u201d\nUnintentional subtext: \u201cTo be King! My plan worked! Push Danny\u2019s buttons until she snaps, let duty bound Jon kill her off and then roll in as the leader of the seven (sigh, six) kingdoms.\u201d \nRewatching the show from this perspective will really change your views on Bran\u2019s journey I think.
The \"Bran is evil\" theory relies on some really weird beliefs about the quality of D&D's writing.\n\nIn order for it to work, their writing is bad enough that the \"true\" resolution of the main plot is only conveyed through a particular interpretation of 2-3 vague things that Bran says and a particular interpretation of his vaguely defined powers, all of which completely runs against the tone of the end of the episode\n\nAND\n\ntheir writing is also good enough that the interpretation of these few lines isn't just the unintended implication of the few lines that they wrote.
lol if he shut his mouth about Jon's heritage none of this would have happened
\"It's your choice, Jon\"\n\n\"The future is written\"\n\nSo the guy who knows the future is written also tells a dude that he has a choice?
Maybe something even worse would have happened. Dany's madness seems to have been an inevitable development, so is it better to let a single city burn or save it but then Dany goes mad years down the line when she's got an empire stretching across 2 continents comprising tens of millions of people?
But Varys actively tried to stop it.
Well according to the survey 88% of people saw that.
Same. Plus that badass never lost a battle. What a stud.
He was a lot more of a dumbass in the show though. He just fell in love and abandoned his vow instead of choosing Jeyne's honor over his own after a moment of weakness when he found out his brothers were murdered. \n\nThe parallels to Ned sacrificing his own honor were a lot more satisfying.
Ned?
[deleted]
What about Ned? He might've been an honorable fool, but he knows how to keep a damn secret. Robb broke his oath and got his family and men killed.
You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain.
Should have just married the Frey girl.
Long Live Robb!
They kind of forgot about spellcheck.
Too bad Game of Thrones is over or they could all have bright futures writing for the show
Not as if they are being paid millions to do it though
Or they dont actually know english because they **dont speak english** besides Google Translate English :P

It's not impossible to do at all. There are software that does this instantly with a click of a button, nVivo for example, possibly many others that are open source.
we kind of forgot about that
Are you talking about the viewers or the writers!?
yes
BuT iT wOuLd Be A tOuChInG mOmEnT
Seems like a lot of people assume the plot is going to make as little sense as the plot has made previously
Then why is everyone mad?
Especially the writers of the show \ud83d\ude48
IMO Arya has like 10% chance of even getting back to Westeros
Bran had like 0.01% chance to become King. Arya won't just be coming back, she'll tow Westereros back east with her boat.
\"You underestimate my plot armour!\"
Arya is going to die at sea. Everyone who has ever sailed west has never come back. Unless, of course, her plot armor will protect her, but if she was anyone else, she'd die.
Probably because the rulers are the two characters people care the least about. They want to see a Jon & Arya reunion though.
Of course that was the reason. People thinking with emotion and not actually answering thequestion.
Lol they\u2019re other sides of the planet, and Bran and Sansa rule the only two kingdoms in Westeros and have plenty to discuss for terms. How is the former meeting even remotely as likely as the second meeting.
The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Holy Roman Empire were bastions of peasant liberty and political stability, dontcha know? /s
\\^This comment will not receive the deserved number of upvotes.
Not going to comment on the Commonwealth as I do not know much about it, but the HRE had lots of things that were better than in the absolute kingdoms surrounding it. For example it had a semi-independent judiciary, it had free cities that were on equal footing with nobility and who could conduct their own affairs and (admittedly after huge wars) it had a degree of religious tolerance that was missing from England, Spain and France.
Couldn't help but read that as stab-ility and thought, you know what that still works.
If anything the elective monarchy would cause more problems and mean there\u2019s going to most likely be a war every time the king dies
\"The Wheel\" has always been ambiguous and stupid. Does it mean literally what Dany said where the switching of families on the throne crushes the common people? Families only ever switched once, though. Does it mean different families fighting for power, rather than the throne directly? Does it mean the way nobles treat commoners? How was anyone meant to break it? What Dany going to end all houses and rule alone? Was she going to execute any differing opinions? How would she stop scheming?\n\nNothing about it made sense.
Her speech hinted at an \"Enlightened monarchy\" and that is the only explanation that makes sense. \"The Wheel\" is as abstract as the \"Game of Thrones\" and it really looks like both are the same. Breaking the wheel at least promised taking the power from the Great houses. The reign she promised at least isn't a tyranny against commoners but having consolidated power under her breaking the feudal structure.\n\nNow with the elective monarchy the game to reach the top will become even bigger and stronger. So the wheel isn't broken but is replaced with a bigger, stronger wheel.
the last 3ER lived for like 150 years, and died because of the NK not of natural causes. it seems 3ER are almost immortal.
Because a big part of the wheel was the concept of ownership of the throne based on bloodline. Whether or not an elective monarchy would run more smoothly, that toxic idea was eliminated, with the exclamation point being Jon not getting it as the undisputed last heir.
But Bran is immortal. They have a far greater problem now. A King that can see any rebellions or attempts to usurp him coming
But that will cause more LittleFinger and Varys characters to appear and manipulate on who to become kings. And when they'll not like the king anymore, guess who's getting the poison?
But the system is still broken. Each house will still continue on the same concept and more power struggle will arise within the regions and houses as each house have a shot at the highest position. The new system is hardly innovative as the Iron Islands has the same system and it didn't work better for them.
How do you think the Paramounts will be chosen? How do you think the King in the North will be chosen?\n\nOwnership based on bloodline is still strong and that\u2019s assuming that Brans \u201celective monarchy\u201d actually stays stable, which I seriously doubt.
sources?
Also you have a monarch that has all-seeing powers. Big Brother, can see everything, and every citizen is under constant surveillance. He let King's Landing burn, and he will definitely abuse that power.
One would think that the fact that the only elective monarchy in Westeros chose none other than EURON as their King would serve as a hint against this system.
If you put Tywin in at the end of the show, it would be a Lannister monarchy within a month.
especially in this last season,  it seemed much more of a catch phrase that any type of firm plan of the future.  \n\nWhen she is inspiring the crowd and tries to get a chant going 'will you help me break the wheel'  my reaction was 'what does that even mean?'\n\nClearly, it meant to take her armies (dothraki back to horde size, and the reformed unsullied) and conquer all known lands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9Bo89m2f6g\n\nShe clearly explained it.\n\nI'm just not sure how anyone thinks it is broken
To be honest, the only way to \"break the wheel\" in this god-forsaken world is exactly what Dany was planning. If everyone is kept in line through fear, there won't be any wars or backstabbing. Dany made an example out of the people of KL, so if she actually became Queen and took over the world, people would understand what would happen to them if they attempted to revolt. She'll literally bring hell-fires down on you, as she's proven she'll go as far as she needs to go. What she did to KL tells the people that she's not afraid to kill whoever she needs to (innocent or otherwise) in order to keep the people in-line.\n\nIf she ruled the world with an Iron Fist, there would be no wars and everyone would listen to her out of fear. That's what I call \"breaking the wheel\", at least in the world of ASOIAF. If one Lord attempts to rise up against her, Drogon will literally melt their keep and kill their entire family and they won't be able to do anything about it. Very effective leadership tactic in this world imo. Daenerys Stormborn will bring her wrath whenever she needs to, which is effectively breaking the wheel.
The dothraki: \"is the queen dead? Good, whew, now we can go back to being law abiding citizens\"
The show just kind of forgot about the Dothraki.
The Dothraki just kind of forgot they all died at Winterfell, and like a Loony Tunes character when they realized they all instantly died again.
But why would he care if all the Kingdoms came down on them? They're the unsullied, facing certain death without flinching is kind of their thing.\n\nAnd why call/wait for the council at all? Why not just execute them straight away? They had Jon and Tyrion in the dungeon for weeks before all the lords arrived.
Well because Greyworm isn't *really* an Unsullied anymore. After meeting Missandei, he had all the same feelings any other character did.\n\nHe was more interested in protecting Naath for Missandei probably. After the rage of Dany's death, then the acceptance a few weeks later, I'm sure he understands
Jon definitely knew she had done wrong way before Tyrion mentioned his sisters. That\u2019s why he stopped fighting in the streets when she was burning the city.
Jon was so poorly written that it's hard to know who he was anymore. This season he seems to be utterly stupid and too in love with Dany to think clearly. At least that's what the show was pushing. He said he himself he didn't know what he'd do if he was Dany on top of Drogon in that moment. Yeah, I don't get it either. The Jon we all knew would have reacted differently. But this is season 8 where characters we knew don't make any sense anymore.
Yet in the next episode we get him arguing for her for 5 minutes before coming to his senses.
Even then Tyrion did care but he wasn't willing to make the sacrifice of abandoning his evil and bloodthirsty house and family for it until it was his life at stake.
Read the post again. They brought up democracy as an *example* of breaking the wheel. They're saying Dany's definition of the wheel remains intact after the finale.
Chill out, Marx. I'm just saying the wheel of elite families ruling over the little people hasn't changed in a television show
The wheel is the never ending changing of power from one person to another. The wheel can never be broken but the process in which who is selected to have that power can be. No longer is the changing of power happening by force but by selection. Dany was just another spoke on the wheel.
Oooo how I miss college.
She literally nothing personal kid-ed the NK.
\"Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru\" - Arya to the Night King.
personnel*
I enjoy anime and I'm certain Arya wasn't that...
felt little weird that Arya didn't use face swapping since they spent so much time for that training before. would also have been neat if Arya could've gotten near NK using some of that trick.
Exactly
How would that trick have worked against the NK? I can't think of a way. What face in her bag would have allowed her to casually get next to the NK without him or his generals knowing something was up? When you kill a WW they disintegrate so there's no face peeling ritual she can perform to look like a white walker.
I'm personally thinking the South is going to face an economic collapse and revolts soon if Bronn remains Master of Coin, but yeah the weather is better so I'd rather live there. But if the North was warmer I'd probably like to hang out in Winterfell.
I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
Bruh this kind of logic doesn't exist in the world post-ending anymore, given the lord of the other six kingdoms literally didn't have their own interests in mind at the time of Bran's crowning.
I guess the North would also pick their own ruler then? But there wold be no stark in winterfell. I honestly don't know why I care anymore anyway...
Arya would be Sansa's immediate heir, but she might be a bit difficult to reach.
I'm pretty sure men always inherit before women in every Kingdom except for Dorne, both inherit on equal grounds and the Iron Islands, in which they have their own funny little election and offerings.\n\nSo Sansa's immediate heir would be Bran. Infact, Sansa only got to be \"King/Queen in the North\" because the title didn't exist at the time and the northeners had to choose someone to lead them.\n\nOnce Sansa passes away, the title is no longer up for \"re-election\" but will instead pass on to her offspring, and in case she doesn't have offspring, her siblings and then their nephews.
I voted Arya and Jon because of the bad writing. If the show was as internally consistent or as politically savvy as the earlier seasons then Sansa and Jon or Sansa and Bran are the obvious choices.  The show no longer makes sense so I think Jon and Arya reuniting is more likely because it would be a surprise and an emotional beat for the audience.
We really don\u2019t know that. If we had access to the raw data we could look at that, and it might indeed be interesting. But speaking for myself, I complained very vocally about bad writing and I picked Bran and Sansa to reunite.
There are way more people who liked this episode (30% rated it 8+) than votes on even the most popular reunion (13%).
That's not how anonymous surveys work
There is a YouTuber named JonTron
I read somewhere that he was dying and in the process of turning but was stabbed in the heart with dragonglass by the children of the forest
Realizes she is not no one, but a Stark. Gets back home, immediately frees her wolf, tells her family she will never see them again. A lot of characters feel like in earlier season their character had progression and in 8 they had regression.
Either maisie williams or the character herself has gotten her ego inflated because she walks around in every episode like she's the fucking shit and it really annoys me
[deleted]
Literally dies and is brought back for what?  Bending the knee or killing Dany (which someone else easily could've done)
I guess he was brought back to get Dany. Nobody else from the north would have tried to seek her out. So he was a big part of why the NK was killed.
Jon and Dany were both tools for the lord of light. Jons purpose was to unite fire and ice in order to defeat the night king, which undoubtedly would not have happened without those dragons. Once that purpose was fulfilled, he needed to remove fire from the equation as no one should have that kind of power. Which he did and then he was freed to go live a duty free life in the wild. He fulfilled everything the lord of light intended him to. It was necessary for him to be targ because it would have been difficult for anyone else to eliminate dany with her dragon protecting her. His targ blood made it possible for him to get past drogon.
He was brought back because, as hinted heavily in the books, he\u2019s meant to stop the white walker threat. However, readers put this together years ago and d&d wanted to subvert expectations so they rewrote the story and made Arya the one to kill the NK... even though it makes zero fucking sense.
I feel like people are being purposefully ignorant when they say this, if not for Jon the wildlings are likely executed, Ramsey continues to rule the North, Daenerys never even considers the Great War, the Night King probably destroys Westeros. And he stops Dany from destroying the planet.\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t even need to be all of that, it could\u2019ve just been a little thing. Pretty sure there\u2019s a bit of dialogue about it before the Battle of Bastards. \u201cWhy did he bring me back?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe for a higher purpose. Or Maybe he brought you back just to die again today.\u201d \u201cWhat cruel kind of god is that?\u201d \u201cThe one we\u2019ve got.\u201d
> Viserion spits fire at him, he hides behind a rock, survives (this is even more ridiculous when you see what Drogon did to King's Landing)\n\nWe even see Viserion's fire destroy the walls of Winterfell just minutes before this scene
> Grey Worm doesn't kill him immidiately when he finds out he killed his Queen, even though he slaughtered Lannister soldiers for much less \n\nSo much this. The characters change their attitude in 0,5 secondes.
I think Jon has had the most plot armor out of any character, even more than Arya.  He should have logically died Gods know how many times after he actually did die.  In Battle of the Bastards, Beyond the Wall and The Long Night he should have died countless times.  At least in BOTB and BTW he didn't get saved by \"let's cut away to another scene\"
Drogon should have tried to burn him, even with the required retcon.  That could have given a reason for Drogon and company to not kill him but then you have his \"story\" being even more better than Bran's.
Drogon's main attack gets +80 explosive vs stone, while Undead Viserion has a passive blizzard, an AoE ability which slows nearby enemies.
>Drogon doesn't kill him even though he killed his mom\n\nHe's a Targaryen. There's a pretty strong indication that dragons inherently bond with Targaryens.\n\n>Grey Worm doesn't kill him immidiately when he finds out he killed his Queen, even though he slaughtered Lannister soldiers for much less\n\nGrey Worm seems conditioned to only act on orders from authority. The executions were on Dany's orders. Notice how when Bran put his foot down (figuratively speaking) as king, Grey Worm quieted down and followed his orders.
Targaryen dragons killed other Targaryen during their civil war. Dragons only bond with one rider.
And only killed the Waif after getting three fatal stab wounds from her in three seconds followed by an abdomen full of rank harbor bacteria.
Actually annoyed me because Drogo was killed by a small, infected wound showing that people no matter their strength can succumb to nature. Meanwhile someone who's less physically fit with worse wounds, is thrown somewhere that's extremely likely to contain harmful bacteria, and is perfectly fine rather quickly after minor treatment of the wound.
It was two stabs with a small knife in the lower right abdomen where there are no vital organs.  Infection was a possibility but not guaranteed.  I find the Hound's survival less likely than Arya's but people don't go on and on about that.
Show Arya is pretty fantastic in the first four seasons, but honestly suffers the most from season 5 and beyond. The Braavos shit is so, horrifyingly awful.
Show Arya's story went to shit in S6 and never recovered
Show Arya is my favorite. I don\u2019t like her in the books.
I still think it would of been a better choice to leave the night king to Jon, but have Arja kill Dany. In episode 5 with Arja being in the thick of the carnage, I was sure they were setting it up so she was going to kill Dany.\n\nThan again, I would of prefered Jorha to have to kill Dany, that would of been something.
I weirdly wanted her to find Melisandre's necklace and take over her position!
I honestly kept on expecting a faceless assassin to kill her at some point so that they could at least do something relevant.
That was not Arya's whole arc.\n\nEdit.  Added \"whole\".
Her getting poisoned back in Braavos and then somehow surviving because Lady Crane found her lying on the floor would make more sense than having her surviving major stab wounds in her stomach and still being able to run around and swim, like what the fuck.\n\nThe faceless men aren't even known to be stabby. They always make their kills look like accidents.
This is what pisses me off so much with Arya's storyline. I feel like she basically scammed the faceless men but everyone just acts like she completed her training and is one of them now, even though she still retains her identity, like you can't have both. Arya's story would've been way more interesting if they fully committed to her losing her identity in trying to seek vengeance but the showrunners  just wanted to play up to everyone's love of Maisie Williams.
Yea, the internet turns people into irrational hate machines.  But the hate for Arya is mild compared to for others.  Arya is the best.
It seems to have taken over Reddit after the finale and is in direct contrast to the Reddit polls.  So, I think it\u2019s a vocal minority.
I don't know about the books, but I disagree with this notion that the bullet points of the ending were fine, only the execution sucks.\n\nIn the context of the show, Bran becoming king, Daenerys going crazy and Jaime going back to Cersei are horribly unsatisfying endings. \"Oh, but Game of Thrones is not a fairytale!\"\n\nI'm not asking for fan-service, but these endings aren't bittersweet, they're downright sadistic. Daenerys' whole arc, in my view, is about her learning how to be a leader, and to reject her family's troubled history and legacy, and build her own. Does she have to end up on the throne? Not necessarily, but how does a character that has surrounded herself with multiple counselors and constanly asked for advice can have \"goes batshit insane, whatever\" as a satisfying conclusion? Why not use the fact that Jon is not only a Targaryen himself, but actually knew one (Maester Aemon) as a way to show her \"hey, not all Targaryens are conquerors or crazy, huh\"?\n\nAnd I've seen people bring up that Jaime is like an addicted who wants to get rid of it, but can't. Fine, I get the point, but... that's not narratively satisfying. You can't just have a \"tragic\" ending like that just for the sake of it. Have him kill Cersei and die in the process, it's not rocket science.\n\nThe execution was a tragedy, but the bullet points were very underwhelming too, or downright nonsensical in Bran's case. Again, at least on the context of the show, don't know about the books. Maybe it makes sense there.
> And I've seen people bring up that Jaime is like an addicted who wants to get rid of it, but can't. Fine, I get the point, but... that's not narratively satisfying. You can't just have a \"tragic\" ending like that just for the sake of it. Have him kill Cersei and die in the process, it's not rocket science.\n\nExcept that what you just said completely changes it from being tragic to palatable. It's not supposed to be easily palatable, it's supposed to leave a bad taste in your mouth, that's part of the tragedy. Jaime is like a character that has struggled with heroin for 8 seasons, and finally manages to break free in season 7, but when death is imminent you see him reach for one last hit and fall back into his addiction right before a meteor hits his house and kills him. It's bittersweet and tragic because you learn that in the end he never truly broke free of his addiction, but in the very end at least he was happy with his drug, and more tragedy because you wonder if his heroin was the only thing that ever made him feel happy, and that's why he chose it at death's door.
This is an adaptation issue and it does not make sense in the show because of how many characters and plot-lines are changed/omitted.  I fully believe these are the broad strokes of Martin's ending. The entire series was inspired by and starts with Bran's story so I believe him becoming the King is very believable in the context of the books, but came out of the left field on the show because D&D can't flesh things out like Martin does. Bran and Jon's stories are flipped on its head. Jon is the Aragorn figure with the Frodo ending while Bran is the Frodo figure with the Aragorn ending. \n\nAs for Dany, her arc was always very ominous, and there's plenty of hints in the books that she will eventually succumb to her Fire and Blood impulses, but not necessarily lose her mind like the show implied - which I think is an oversimplification of her downfall. She tries to overcome her nature of Fire and Blood by surrounding herself with advisors, but in the end, despite her attempts to make it work that just does not make her happy. Peace did not give her her ideal world - she had to reopen the fighting pits and agree to the return of slavery in the name of peace. She had to tolerate what she sees as injustice because she tried to make peace work, but it just doesn't, not for her.\n\nDany has a strong belief in her own moral code and has a giant savior complex. To her, she truly believes what she is doing is right, and if Fire and Blood is the only way she can \"save\" others and make her ideal world happen, then so be it. She decided in her very last chapter that it was time to embrace Fire and Blood, otherwise she will get nowhere. \"If I look back, I am lost\". \n\nI think the reason why people felt betrayed by Dany's heel turn, aside from the very rushed season 7-8, was the omission of the entire fake Aegon Targaryen plot line in the books. I think this will be sort of similar to her plot line with Jon in the show. fAegon will be seen as a good king, a glimmer of hope after he deposes mad queen Cersei, but Dany comes in with her army of rapers and pillagers, exiles like Tyrion and Jorah and three nukes. She sees herself as a \"savior\". But the people of Westeros don't need saving. There are no chains for her to break. Here, she's just another invader, and in Westeros she can only rule through Fire and Blood.
Totally agree.  They should have abandoned the book endings and written a good ending for the show.  These plot points were never going to work in the show no matter how many more episodes they added.
I think George will be able to do it with the final two books, but I do think it\u2019s incredibly hard to wind all of his narrative to the ending in a meaningful way which is why it\u2019s taking so long to write. The show felt very much like it glossed over all the details, so while enough the ending had enough content to make it feasible understandable, it didn\u2019t feel earned.
Yeah, I completely agree. I think that the story COULD have been fine if they would have done it the way they used to, slow and methodical. They really needed more seasons to wrap things up the way they wanted to. This way it just felt rushed and really badly executed. \n\nSeriously, this season has episodes where more big events or character twists occur than the entirety of season three or four.
He\u2019s not doing 3 books it\u2019s 2. Hell we might not even get 2 anyway.
Oh I know he is saying it is 2... I just feel like I would be astonished if it didn't turn into 3, based on how much left there is to cover. It started out as a trilogy... then 4 books... then 6... now it is supposed to be 7, but I feel like even if WoW comes out, GRRM will at some point tell us he actually is gonna need 8 books to finish the story.
I can understand that perspective, but I do think this is different than a show such as Lost or Dexter for example where the ending was conceptually unsatisfying. At least for me, the part of GOT final season that I didn\u2019t feel satisfied with was the lack of character development, meaningful dialogue, and conflict that brought the show there. It felt more like the shallow cliff notes version of the ending, which is upsetting after having so much depth to the earlier seasons. That being said, I was far more ok with how the story ends than I was with how it was told.

Like how The Long Night trivializes most of Jon's arc involving WW.
The four most intriguing story lines (Jon, Bran, Arya, NK) due to their potential outcomes will now be meaningless filler due to their actual outcome. Wtf even is this season. They somehow blew a 4-0 lead in a 7 game series. Seems impossible but they fucking did it.
Please, I'll keep injecting Hardhome straight into my veins for years to come. \n\nWhat a fucking fantastic episode.
That\u2019s like saying Eisenhower didn\u2019t do shit in WWII cause the Soviets killed Nazi.
Just because he didn't get to stab the main villain doesn't mean his WW arc is trivialized. He's still most responsible for uniting Westeros against the White Walker threat. Not to mention the major role he plays in the rest of the season.
Arya killing him is fine with Me. Jon\u2019s arc was about getting everyone together and leading the fight. He did that.
They always felt like filler to me anyway. Bran's scenes during the show were easily my least favorite. Hell, I barely even remember any of it, just dreading when the inevitable next Bran scene would be where they are all still aimlessly walking north having some meaningless dialog. \n\nArya was, in general, a great character, but she definitely had her share of filler, too. Her scenes in the House of Black and White for instance were awful. The 4th or 5th time you see her being abused and/or being ignored by Jaqen were more than enough.
The end pretty much makes irrelevant like 60-70% of the show
I\u2019m going to be so mad rewatching everything happening with Bran. He goes through so much shit, and other people around him are killed or have their minds broken to keep him alive, only to have whatever interesting mysticism linking him with the wierwood trees, the night king, the wall, the warging etc. go completely unresolved. The whole magic side of the show was left as dozens of loose ends in favor of an Arya sneak attack, then Bran who\u2019s been entirely disconnected by choice from the human political drama swoops in at the last second to become king for no reason; with no basis for why he would want it or why the rest of the lords would support him.
You could say the same about all the Margaery stuff, but in that case it doesnt feel like filler, just like a much much better exposition about how not every character will live out his whole arc
A lot of scene of other characters will start to feel like filler I bet. Problem is a ton of Bran scenes were boring before this and now they are infuriating.
Rewatching would be depressing, the first scene of the entire series is now a parody!
That makes sense honestly. Episode 2 had some super cool scenes (like Brienne's knighting) that are amazing because they are \"supposedly\" the last time you'll see all these characters alive and together. Then Episode 3 comes along, nobody in that scene dies, the Night King wasn't really that big of a deal, and all of a sudden, the previous episode loses a lot of love because much of it didn't mean anything.
Yeah, they were good, but as a setup for what came after it, they are now basically worthless...\n\nThat's also why I feel like the whole season's rotten rating looks too high now. Boosted by some ultimately insignificant setup episodes, while the ultimate payoff is rotten as can be
Speaking the truth.
Yes, I noticed that too. This downward trend started with episode 3, since then the scores have dropped lower and lower for all the episodes.
Which is fucking stupid, it\u2019s just petty brigading driven by spite. Rank the last 3-4 episodes lower all you want.
Well there's 2 reasons i can think of for that. In isolation those episodes were decent and this rated fairly highly. But after the last 4 episodes they ultimately became pretty pointless beacuse nothing really happend to further the plot.\n\nThen there's also the part of the fanbase that just retroactively downvotes everything beacuse they're angry with the finale. Like i absolutely hated the finale or atleast how things went down, i'm not gonna go back and retroactively reduce ratings like that.
I've been watching that too. We're .1 point away from not having a single episode at 8 or higher. Fascinating to watch.
Yeah... personally I skip all Ned scenes, Robb Scenes and Oberyn scenes on my rewatches...  because all that matters about ANYTHING is how it ends,  not how it lives.\n\nyeah, no.   the Night King mattered, certainly not as much as he should have, but he mattered, he killed the previous three-eyed Raven, essentially forging Bran,  wiped out the last of House Umber and Karstark, nearly genocided the wildlings, united  Jon and Daenerys armies against him,  killed a dragon, caused a good portion of the losses that caused Daenerys to go off the deep end.  and would have wiped out the entire world if not for the (admittedly clumsy) culmination of Arya's training, because Dany's army with its tens of thousands of Dothraki, Thousands of Unsullied and two dragons BARELY won, nothing would have had a chance after that, which was the trap the story fell into.\n\nJon's lineage tipped the scales of Dany's choices, her entire reason for 'choosing fear' was that Jon was clearly the more loved of the valid candidates,  his arc also emphasised the idiocy of divine right, Jon's last leadership role ended with him being stabbed to death.   it was never about his right to be king, it was always about how he neither wanted to be a king, nor was he the best suited.   his entire story was about the shift from being a bastard pariah to finding a place where he belonged, mattered and could be important to people,  he was completely swayed to the Freefolk lifestyle back in Season 3, only rejecting it out of moral obligation to the Night's Watch,\n\nthe a huge portion of the story is contingent on lies, false narratives and the conflict they cause.  the story that Rhaegar kidnapped Lyanna incited the events that culminated in Robert's rebellion,  the lies of Joffrey's parentage propagated the war of five kings,  to have Bran's ultimate destiny be that of the King who can see through these falsehoods is a strong thematic hook, it just isn't handled very well.   it doesn't ruin his story in retrospect.
Thank you. I winced with embarrassment when angry joe said Jon\u2019s lineage and resurrection didn\u2019t matter at all. Whether you enjoyed the series and execution or not, that\u2019s simply objective nonsense at best.
Yeah nobody rates shit like the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie lower just because the later ones were shit
Don't worry mate, winter is only a couple of episodes :)
[deleted]
Still cold
this is what I thought! nearly everyone agreed on bran knowing what was going to happen and still letting thousands of thousands of people get burned alive so he could sit on the throne (or just on his wheelchair by whatever is left of drogon's anguish). so why why why would anyone want to live under his rule? I think I'd rather have sansa as my queen, as she does seem to have at least some experience with these politics.
It is better to be under someone's rule like that, than to be against them.\n\nIf he were letting thousands of people die with that decision, then how many people do you think he is letting die with Winterfell's newfound independence?\n\nThe little sociopath probably knows that The North doesn't have the means to keep itself fed through winter and would rather give them their independence so that they starve to death, rather than have them stick around and be a burden to the rest of the realm.
Right. She also has the experience with the logistics of ruling. \n\nHowever, I am honestly not a huge fan of her either.\n\nJon: I need you to keep a secret.\nSansa: Ok.\nAlso Sansa: Hey Tyrion...
Does it really matter? As a commoner I'd probably live a life of whatever no matter who reigns so I'd rather live a place where it is warm.
I imagine some of the people in Kings Landing felt similarly, and Bran did nothing to stop it. \n\nIn fact, I could argue he was a contributing factor to it happening.
The only good reply I've really gotten. I hate being cold too
I wanna live in Dorne with all the bisexuals!
Also, how the hell does Westeros have control of the wall when it's in the north now?
Or being a total bitch to the Lord of the Riverlands - a region that until that moment were entirely devoted to answering the call for the Starks whenever they were in need.\n\nShe doesn't make alliances - she breaks them.
Or openly asking for independence from your brother in front of the rulers of the other Kingdoms, essentially ensuring future revolts.
The funny thing is, in terms of a rewatch, the Lannisters are by far the best to see their arcs again. Cersei literally having her house of cards fall on her. Jaime having a all too realistic relapse (it seems weird on a show, but this is exactly what addiction is like, and it's often never depicted this well) and Tyrion actually having the bittersweet ending of having a high power he doesn't want.
Plus, the big woman. And I hear she's single now.
Edmure shouldn't have spoken.  He has had nothing to offer the world besides his value as a hostage for years.  His sad sack performance at Riverrun tells you all you need to know about him
Oh yeah right, he should've let his infant child and his men be slaughtered, sure.
Yep. It's a little vindication. \n\nI really, really wish it had gone otherwise, though.
Oh yeah, I totally agree. The big thing for me is that I never really got time to dislike or question Daenerys. She was a little cold at times, but out of nowhere she torches kings landing? And they never really actually show her on the dragon once she is destroying everything. I found it hard to connect the action to her. \n\nThen 5 minutes later she is dead. It was too much too quickly.
Yeah I would give practically anything to have the series finished out strong. It was in contention for my favorite series of all time and now it can\u2019t really hold a candle to them.
Honestly, only the second episode had any real depths to it. The scene where Brienne got knighted and Pod sang is so darn good. \n\nOverall the character interactions was more than shallow one-liners.\n\nBy far the best episode this season, and the only episode I'd call good.
I wholeheartedly agree. By the time we got to the small council meeting I was pretty much over the one liners. \n\nThe second episode had some great depth (relatively) to it. It was also genuinely funny with the giants milk story lol
Why, because than you feel justified to have an opinion?
I wouldn't say that. It does make me feel more justified IN my opinion. \n\nIt also gives me people that have similar feelings to talk to about it.\n\nAnd some of the people that have spoken out against the season as a whole, have donated a good chunk of change to Emilia's charity which may or may not have happened otherwise.

> And who the fuck is Aaron Rodgers\n\nif you're actually serious he's the Packers quarterback and he was an extra in episode 5
Only 11%? Damn people here really are way to generous to this last season.
Hahahahaha, dude that was HILARIOUS! Game of Thrones is bad!!!
Always? Absolutely not. Up until ep4 where Rhaegal died the majority of the people were pretty satisfied with the show.
Yup, but I think FFN is where all the dany haters ended up
So... we should tune out everyone who's online and well informed? Sure. I'll ask my grandmother.   \n\nAnd also- have you not seen Facebook, twitter and instagram? The amount of hate there surpasses this.
> If Ned Stark's execution happened in this season, it would be described as \"trashy\" and \"lazy writing\".\n\nIf Ilyn Payne jumped off a balcony in King's Landing and stabbed Ned while saying something super edgy because he kinda forgot he had no tongue, yeah.

I would say most (albeit not all) of what happens in the finale is consistent with the show narrative, but somehow it seems this sub is not accepting a *single* thing about the ending. It's all shit.
I don't think it's stranger than any other character this season or the previous one.\n\nI just think it's weird the voters clearly love her but the comment section reflects the opposite
Comment sections are always cancerous.   Look at any comment section anywhere online and its the same.  Hate is a strong emotion and people want to vent.  And the internet allows them a degree of anonymity so they say things that they would never say in person.
That\u2019s not what their comment was about.
This is probably the most show positive sub.
if you really believe that, I recommend subs like r/asoiafcirclejerk and r/DanAndDaveFanclub r/SansaWinsTheThrone (and probably other GoT Character Sub-subreddits). You will see that this sub is still extremely negative.
Well that's just silly.
Agreed. I think every ill with the season can be tied to the decision to the shorten the last two season.
It went from character driven stories to a plot driven narratives.  They took all those ending moments you point out (spinoffs) and then worked backwards to the first episode.
There has to be some fall out for this? If they had finished the show with the quality of the first 6 seasons they would have been gods in the directing/writing world, anyone with a movie or series to shoot would have given anything to have them involved. After how they treated this ending I would be apprehensive to give them any story I had written, what if they half ass the end again? What if they half ass the whole thing?\n\nThere was only 1 chance to do this show given how it started, no one is going to want to re do it as it would be compared to the original 6 season's and it would almost definitely fall short, you cant just re do the end in 10 years as thats stupid. \n\nAt the half way point of this show, with the quality that it was they had guaranteed this was the only chance to tell the story right and they didn't do it. Now it will always be not as good as it could have been, and I dont want them to get away with it.
What interests me is the connection with Star Wars now.  Disney must be in full damage control mode.  People are mad/disappointed in D&D and will likely take it out on Star Wars cause it's the only real action they can take against these two.
There should be but there is no god of justice, only the god of tits and wine.
I have no doubt that some HBO executives are punching themselves in the dick right now. Probably ganging up on the poor bastard who argued for the \"artistic freedom\" to allow D&D to finish the show the way they wanted to.
D&D really shouldn't be allowed to write any more. Imagine them utterly destroying other long-beloved franchises. This is worse than Michael Bay's version of stories.
Here, here! (applause)
D&D don't care.  Disney threw boatloads of cash and 4 star wars movies at them.
Judging by the viewer numbers, I highly doubt it.
uh... maybe not?  at least one higher up was complimenting them.  smh.
Has there been any comments about the ratings from HBO or D&D? Arguably the biggest show in TV just ended and I haven't really seen anything from the people in charge
>the end of episode 3\n\nFTFY
Yeah even though many fans weren\u2019t admitting it at the time the show died with the NK being inexplicably shanked out of nowhere by a character whose plot has had nothing to do with the Army of the Dead.  \n\nCersei and Euron were laughably contrived OP final bosses. What were the stakes once the NK was killed? Nothing, and that was the issue. Why should i care at all about the battle for the iron throne when Dany has been outrageously nerfed since 7.01? Not to mention she defeats the Lannisters in *exactly* the same way she could have done in 7.01. All her defeats in S7, the entire NK plot and battle of Winterfell - Lol yeah none of it mattered, all you need is Drogon to take the city
I agree. This was the episode that really cemented the fact that the show was beyond saving. They basically ruined one of they key plotlines of the entire series in a matter of minutes.
>the Wight Hunt in season 7\n\nFTFY
>all of episode 3
DURING episode 3. \n\nFTFY
>the end of Season 7\n\nFTFY
>the end of episode 3\n> FTFY\n\nThe start of Episode 3 \n\nFTFY
by episode 4 is essentially the same as the end of episode 3
Episode 3 tanked the show. It made all the previous seasons pointless. I was the biggest GoT fan up until episode 3, and then I just resorted to memes and leaks to be able to cope with the disappointment.
*season 5\n\nEdit: I originally put season 6 because at least season 5 had Hardhome, but even that doesn't rule out Dorne
The best episode of s8 is inarguably 2.
inarguably is a very funny word to use when it comes to opinions
Have a real discussion or any kind of real interaction between Dany and Jon, that explained her actions and made us actually think he liked her. \n\nShow the fallout of her death! How are you going to kill the arguably main character of a story and just skip over all of the fallout, show no emotional reactions from any of the characters except her dragon?\n\nHave Jon and Greyworm fight. They built up to it before this, and there's simply no way Greyworm would let Jon live. Or if they're not gonna fight, then *don't* show Greyworm executing prisoners right before this, because those two things don't make sense together. Either he kills prisoners or he doesn't, don't show both in the same episode with no explanation.\n\nDon't make Bran the king, goddamn. So dumb. Either Jon or Gendry are the king, or they just split up all of the kingdoms in this episode. If Jon's not the king, there should be a good political reason, not just \"These guys who are on their way out won't allow it, for the week that they're still on this continent\". Jon should've had a character-defining choice to make in the end, just like Arya did when she gave up her revenge on Cersei, just like Theon did when he died defending Bran. \n\nSansa's political arc should've paid off. Just asking for and being randomly given a kingdom is not Littlefinger-esque scheming; it's no better than the bratty wannabe queen from season 1. This was a complete failure in character development payoff. She should've used her hard-earned wiles to scheme for a better outcome for Jon or the kingdoms.\n\nBronn should be dead, come on. No way he should be lord of Highgarden.\n\nEtc. Etc. There was a lot of stupid stuff in this episode, from the minor to the major, even just off the top of my head.
Jon and Dany did have that interaction and it was more than i could have ever hoped for in one episode to explain her mindset. Not sure why you imply this didnt even happen.\n\nIll agree on the fallout and fight with Grey Worm, but the way they did it was good too because if youre gonna have a time jump it should be after a climactic moment. \n\nMore debate leading to Bran would have been nice but i think he was the perfect choice. \n\nI dont think the point of Sansas arc was to become a schemer, it was to becaome a leader and thats what she did. \n\nBronn was promised Highgarden, Tyrion gave his word. And Bronns point about how houses start was totally right, now this is the follow-through.
I think we all waited for that, and it never happened. And I don\u2019t understand the reasoning behind that. Why introduce story elements like that, just to never use them again?
That sub will make you lose your god damn mind, I swear to god your sanity will be questioned.
Ya I went way too far down the rabbit hole
Apparently, r/gameofthrones, the most favorite of the show are \u201cLawful Evil\u201d to them
That's the best GoT sub among all the madness.
They thought it was so bad that their rating system looped back around and they gave it a 10.
A few thousand people snapped and went mad perhaps?
the first 20mins were ok so its clearly not a 1. the rest was an absolute shit show so it got a solid 3 from me
I didn't even think the first 20 minutes were okay. They were so fucking baffling at every turn.\n\n* Maybe half of it is spent on Tyrion going to find Cersei and Jaime. I get it, he's looking for his siblings. You can still do that, but it didn't need to be literally 5 minutes of walking through streets and corridors, we could have opened the episode with that.\n* Apparently Cersei and Jaime would have been totally fine if they just didn't stand in the one specifically place where bricks fell down.\n* Excited to find out what was with Arya and that horse? Well, it wasn't important, because she just kind of shows up and watches Dany and the horse is nowhere to be seen.\n* Dany is apparently able to speak so loudly that thousands of screaming Dothraki can hear her clearly. I get that she's Dragonborn but she wasn't even shouting, dude.\n* I mostly thought the scene with Tyrion/Jon was okay, but fuck, Jon is REALLY resistant to say anything bad about the girl he dated for literally like *two episodes*, despite her killing what, half a million innocent people?\n* Dany talks like a lunatic and then gets stabbed after about 2 minutes. Cool. Also, Jon holds Dany as she's dying in the *absolute most awkward way possible* (see the picture for Question 4 in this survey). Seriously, it looked so fucking terrible! I haven't seen anybody else mention this but I'm sure people have.\n* Drogon is either apparently able to grasp the complexity of inter-continental politics and power struggles and destroys the throne as a reactionary measure because it is a symbol of power, or maybe he just really fucking hates chairs, who knows.\n* Oh, we time skipped, and apparently Grey Worm just walked Jon out of there for being a bad boy and killing literally the only person left he cares about after already showing himself to be a merciless killer at the start of the episode.\n\nAnd this is just the stuff that I was actually thinking *as I was watching*, there's more to nitpick if you go back and look at it. Honestly, in Episode 5 I mostly watched the episode and then at the end thought \"okay, well, that was pretty damn bad.\" In Episode 6 it was so bad I kept being pulled out of it because I was thinking \"this is just really fucking stupid.\"

So it\u2019s brainless to enjoy something others didn\u2019t now...?
The writing is the core of any show. If the writing isn't any good, nothing else matters. All other things are build upon that foundation.
Would you rate this episode 1/10?
I gave it a 1. In my opinion, no amount of quality acting or amazing production could redeem the horrendous plot and writing. I gave it a 1 because after years of being incredibly invested in this show, the conclusion was so bad that it didn\u2019t feel real.\n\nI got more emotional reading and thinking about theories in the months leading up to S8 than I got during season 8 itself. To me the entire thing just felt like bad fanfiction- too poorly written and illogical to be taken seriously.\n\nI felt nothing when Daenerys went mad. I felt nothing when Jon killed her. I rolled my eyes at Bran and Sansa being king and queen (in the north). I felt a sort of disconnected wtf when Arya killed the NK. Even when Rhaegal died I was mostly like \u201cwtf that makes no sense\u201d.\n\nAnd in many ways that is unfathomable to me. I was so invested in the show, before. Things that would happen could affect my mood all week. I was devastated when Robb died. My stress level and investment in the Mountain vs Oberyn was through the roof. I literally cried in relief when Daenerys escaped the Khals. I was sick to my stomach when Rickon died. \n\nSomehow this season turned me from being that person into someone that feels like \u201cwhatever, this is just frustratingly stupid\u201d for basically every single thing that happens. I think it was because this season really epitomized what has been gradually happening for the past couple seasons- it no longer feels like GoT is a show where actions have consequences. It used to feel so high stakes, like everything was connected to each other- even small actions in Essos would have their effects ripple across to set off chains of events in Westeros. \n\nBut now it just feels like they\u2019re drawing random events out of a hat for the ending. Aaaaand this week we got... drumroll... \u201cRhaegal is going to die, Braime is going to bang, aaaaand 3X dick jokes! Sorry for all those folks who were hoping for Cleganebowl. Tune in next week and remember, the more you tweet @Cleganebowl2019, the more entries it will get in next week\u2019s drawing!\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with me. But that is why, after some thoughtful consideration, I gave it a 1/10. To me, this was basically as bad as \u201cand then aliens invade\u201d. I would have preferred Bran waking up from a dream.
watching the dothraki charge was when my mind just zonked out and the series became a complete joke.  my mind just couldn't handle the utter stupidity of the writing.  watched the rest of the season in a stupor.  writing was utter shit.  so many people don't realize that that the whole battle was the equivalent of a modern army throwing away their guns and charging enemy machine guns with a knife.
So fucking overdramatic my god
The writing is 90% of the show, so a score of \"1\" makes sense.
cinematography = 10.  acting = 10.  music = 10.  directing = 10.  writing = -99.   minimum score 1.  math checks out.
Really?! The acting felt stiff and forced in many places (due to the bad writing). Sure, the visuals and musical score were good... but IMHO, writing is pretty damned important.
This sub really is vicious to the Sansa fans
She's the worst.
It baffles me also
Lol no, a vocal minority are vicious to Sansa fans. The VAST majority of this sub is unreasonably obsessed with her.
The people who read some of the books gave the episode the same rating as those who didn't read the books. It's quite literally in the poll. There's a bit of a discrepancy between these groups and those who have read all five books, but it's fairly normal for more hardcore fans to be less forgiving and way more critical.\n\nI read two of the books before the show was announced. I stopped reading when the show was announced because it's more fun to read a book after having seen the television show than the other way around. When you first read the source material, it's a lot easier to be dissapointed with the television adaptation because you'll have certain expectations. \n\nMeanwhile, when you first watch the adaptation, a lot of content in the books will still be new and fresh because you can't possibly fit all of that into a movie or series. So you'll be more focused on that and less on the comparison.
Yeah, that's an interesting point. I think it's because the last 2 books introduced characters and plotlines that D&D cut out of the show entirely. And now book readers are just realizing that cutting those things crippled the end-story a bit. So people who have read all 5 books are experiencing an extra disappointment that 75% of this sub won't ever know.\n\nEdit:\n> When you first read the source material, it's a lot easier to be dissapointed with the television adaptation because you'll have certain expectations.\n\nThis is spot on. This is why not reading the books is sometimes the better decision.
This is the first time I have ever connected myself to a book series that is incomplete. I have read through multiple times but only after I watched season 1. \n\n...our watch has begun.
And at least you gave them a shot. I am surprised at how many haven\u2019t read the books at all.
the first one, of course.  a friend gave it to me, saying it's the greatest fantasy book ever.  \nI didn't hate it because it was bad.  I thought it was incredible and a well written, realistic, political drama.  It just wasn't anything close to high fantasy, and I love the escape that high fantasy provides and don't mind the tropes.  it was way too gritty and realistic for me.\n\nI resisted watching it for 7 seasons, but that same friend insisted I watch, and I did, and was amazed, and then... well, you know.
Ughh haha it\u2019s hard to say, I would still rate the episode the same because everything was so rushed and undeveloped. But I think my answers to the specific questions regarding the breaking of the wheel and did the series finale change my opinion on the entire show etc differently. Because after being able to make sense of what happened. My opinions regarding the story as a whole changed. Where as right after I watched It I was still trying to figure out how these characters got from where they started the episode to where they where at when they finished It. So in that sense the episode/ season was still kinda shitty. Not everyone deep dives into what happened like us, so there are a lot of people out there that saw the ending and don\u2019t really understand It.
I tried to explain tyrion's trial to a friend that hasn't seen a single episode and I was amused about how stupid it is even if you remove all the complex character and relationships \n\nSoldier wants 2 prisoners executed but for some reason he waits for a trial, comes with prisoner 1 to the trial, no judge is present, prisoner 1 decides who is gonna be the judge for prisoner 2, the judge is literally the most useless person in the room now and decides that prisoner 1 will be excused and will now serve as his assistant and that prisoner 2 will go vacation with his friends and his pet, soldier thinks the punishment is fair and leaves\n\n\nAnd that doesn't even scratch the surface of how non sense this whole scene is
That Lord's council meeting was such a lazy way to end things. They had a prisoner choose the king, and he chose the wrong one.
> I tried to explain tyrion's trial to a friend that hasn't seen a single episode and I was amused about how stupid it is even if you remove all the complex character and relationships\n\nFor a second there I thought you were talking about Tyrion's trial in S4 and was very confused
Like would greyworm care who the new king is?? Why would he let Tyrion speak and choose a king?? Why were they even in the dragon pit to begin with.. to bargain for Jon or choose a king??
Why do you assume it was a trial? I got it as a council of heads of the most powerful houses. Didin't seem like a trial at all.
Howland Reed, the only dude that can verify Jon's heritage, doesn't mention him at all and votes for his weird cousin to be king that he has never met and who also fucked over his daughter. Jesus christ. Aye.
Yeah just this morning I thought \u201cWait why didn\u2019t we get a scene with Yara about Theon?.\u201d As far as we know she isn\u2019t even aware her brother died.
Why did Yara let Arya threaten her like that?
ugh, stop
I was surprised to even see her. Figured they had just forgotten about her. They did, however, forget about who Yara is and the fact that she had already been granted independence.
We don't tend to get that unless it's really pivotal main characters. Didn't really have any reaction to LF dying for example.
Why did Yara say nothing about independence after the North was granted it when that was the reason she allied with daenerys in the first place?
See, these are the issues I really can't get behind. I totally understand people who are saying that the execution these last few episodes felt really rushed. I totally agree. I didn't mind the ending so much as I did how rushed and confusing it all felt.\n\nWhat I don't get are complaints like yours. You are watching a show about dragons. There's already a lot of suspense of disbelief required. So how come it's too difficult to just assume that Yara has been informed about the faith of Theon offscreen? You can poke a lot of holes in nearly any TV show if you require the directors to put all those events on screen.
There honestly isn\u2019t one main character that you can argue their ending made logical and thematic sense. Dany is at close as it gets and that tells you all you need to know about how badly the other characters have been betrayed. I still can\u2019t get over that thread on here with 15k upvotes that was chastising viewers after 8.04 who thought Jaime was going back to Cersei because he loved her rather than to kill her. The denial was incredible...
Theon! Theon had a redemption arc and he completed it, going from trying to/pretending to kill the Stark boys to giving his life protecting Bran when it mattered most (as far as he knew anyway).\n\nArya almost had an arc. She made a choice in e5 to give up her quest for revenge and choose life and, presumably, family. Unfortunately that was not built up to and they also threw it away immediately when she abandoned her family in the next episode.\n\nBran... Who fucking knows.\n\nDany should've been faced with her choice: be merciful, or be the queen. Instead she became the queen and then also murdered tons of people for no reason, and then never explained it and then got shanked. They had all the necessary elements there for her complete arc and completely discarded them because they're incompetent.\n\nJon needed to have a choice between duty and love. When he killed Dany, that didn't really come off as a real choice, because she was a genocidal maniac and he didn't seem to actually like her very much anyway. And then he never had a choice to be king or not after that anyway, his choices were just made for him. His personality was irrelevant to how his story ended.
I was okay with the hound's ending
Oh my god yes. I was in the Jaime is legit returning because he can't shake his addiction camp. I spent that whole week just lurking and refusing to engage with people who thought I was dumb as rocks for thinking that. I stand by my original quote:\n\n> I get that most people are reading it this way, but it seriously felt like a setback in his character arc watching how it played out last night. Hopefully it turns out better than it felt out of the gate.
I\u2019d say Theon has a pretty good ending from a character development point of view.\n\nAfter all the shit he\u2019s done (attacking Winterfell, \u201ckilling\u201d Bran and Rickon), all the shit he\u2019s had to suffer (Ramsay and Euron), I really enjoyed that his final scenes involved defending the same Stark he supposedly killed.\n\nHim randomly charging the Night King with a spear was pretty dumb, but aside from that I was completely on board with his ending.
Haha for me it is the opposite
The more I think about the trial scene the worse it becomes
I had that problem with episode 3. I just rather not think too much. Even when i was watching it. Just annoyed me so much.
If this was an anime, Arya would be the MC
Yup, very true. The crazy things she does in the show wouldn\u2019t change though because they\u2019re already very Anime-y
The Battle of Winterfell was straight outta DBZ. Jon Snow (Vegeta) is built up to defeat the main bad only for Arya (Goku) to swoop in and save the day.
[This parody comic got it right. This is my favorite fanart of GoT ever.](https://i.redd.it/lzjpbuowgzfz.jpg)
Agreed, I love book Arya, but I've **hated** TV Arya with pure loathing ever since she survived the fight against the waif. That was when she took a turn into a generic TV hero who always survives everything and away from realistic GRRM character.\n\nI mean seriously, the crap she pulled over the last 4 seasons is just insanely wrong, including:\n\n* Survived nearly being killed by the waif because it just so happens some random woman can heal deep sword wounds with just a night's rest and let Arya run around like normal the very next day. Even with today's medical technology it would take over a month for you to fully recover from such an injury, and you **definitely** would not be ready to run for your life and fight to the death the very next day.\n\n* Murdering multiple important members of house Frey and cooking them in a pie without **anyone** noticing something was amiss and sounding an alarm.\n\n* Murdering the Lord of house Frey without anyone noticing.\n\n* Murdering the entirety of House Frey and escaping without a single scratch.\n\n* Jumping in out of nowhere (as if from an Arya catapult) to land on and kill the Night King just in the nick of time, despite being far from the Night King a few minutes prior!\n\n* Cheating death at least a half dozen times as the city was being burnt down and destroyed, including surviving a fire blast from Drogon where they cut away from her a second before she clearly was going to be roasted alive.\n\nThis isn't a GRRM character, this is a TV super hero who can always beat hoards of bad guys no matter how long the odds. It's not what Game of Thrones is about.
I loved Arya's character for the first 4 seasons, my favorite along with Tyrion, and even for most of seasons 5-6.\n\nAfter that, she became some superhero ninja vigilante.  They would show good scenes where she shows signs of her humanity, which I liked, but then they would have her go back to smug robotic ninja again.
Agree 100%. The took the 'badass kid' trope and pushed it so far that she became not just uninteresting but unlikable. Plus the stupid smug look she had on her face for 99% didn't help.
>Even with today\u2019s medical technology it would take over a month for you to recover from such an injury\n\nEven with today\u2019s medical technology those wounds would very likely have been fatal. The Waif literally turned Arya\u2019s intestines into fettuccine bolognese. She could\u2019ve bled out in minutes if a large artery such as the common iliac or inferior mesenteric were lacerated. And between the feces seeping from her bowel perforations and the rank harbor water, Arya had a one way ticket to fulminant peritonitis and septic shock. She would\u2019ve needed emergency surgery (repair any lacerated blood vessels, bowel resection, and washout), big gun IV antibiotics, and a blood transfusion to make it.\n\nEDIT: Grammar
Should have been that Arya got killed by the waif and the waif took her face.
You forgot the worst which is her personality, it has become smug and arrogant treating murder like children's play.
The healing thing was dumb I will give you that...  \n\n\nBut the rest makes sense in her character.  She was meant to be an assasain so quiet and sneaky, even her blood drops are louder than her footsteps.  She escaped without a scratch because simply, she killed the entire house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the catapult, she presumably jumped from a top the wall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso she was not shown for like a half hour before she showed up then.  Jon was fighting the dragon in the courtyard right next to where Bran was.  It makes sense she showed up.  After she talked to the Red Woman, she started to travel over to Bran in order to save him.  The timing was convenient yes, but everyone was fixated on the night king at the time.  Nobody heard her coming and she was incredibly sneaky.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever she did have plot armor from the unbelievable amount of injuries she sustained during her fights.
I surprised that these gaps in logic - purely the fault of the writers - can make you hate the character. Her personality traits still developed in a really interesting and compelling way and that's the core of it. (If you disagree then fair enough, but that's a much better reason than \"she has too much plot armour\".)
Arya is one of those characters that was written to be loved in the very beginning and that has basically been carried all these years and even after she became fucking weird. Book Arya is still alright, but show Arya is the single worst character on this show.
Her character has been terribly written since S6 at least and then it got worse once she returned to Westeros and became this edgy obnoxious & ridiculously OP killer with a constant smug face
I'm not really shocked. And the question was choose your favourite Stark, not necessarily the best character in the whole series. Even though her character became very one-note and strange after season 4, the thing is the other 3 living Starks are not really doing much to overtake her as favourite Stark. And she really benefitted from killing the Night King this season.\n\nBran was never going to have a lot of fans. I'm very surprised Jon was not everyone's favourite Stark, but this season was not very good for him. People mostly love what his character represents: a bastard who's actually a prince, the person who was willing to bring everyone together. But personality-wise, sometimes he's lacking in that area because of his quiet and brooding nature, but people remember the spunky rebellious Arya.\n\nSansa is interesting because her fans have really increased over the last 4 seasons, but unfortunately her character was one of the most hated in the beginning. And the people who tend to love Arya won't easily interchange her with Sansa. It also didn't help that this season she was being compared to Littlefinger and Cersei.
So.. what are the problems with her? Besides surviving stuff she shouldn\u2019t survive, what are the problems with how she acts?
To me, her motivations are completely inconsistent. She gives up her assassin training because being a Stark is too important to her, good. She gives up her trip south to kill Cersei when she hears that the Starks took back Winterfell, good. She tells Jon how family is important yada yada. But then after the NK dies, she immediately bails on her family again on what she says is a one-way trip to kill Cersei. Wtf? Didn't we already get over this? Why did she regress by two seasons suddenly with no explanation?\n\nIt's even crazier because she has the power to end the war single-handedly, and just doesn't tell anyone. Like Sansa in the BoB, she lets Jon  lead a battle to his probable death when she knows she could prevent it, if she just told him ahead of time. This makes absolutely no sense as a character decision.\n\nThen she decides not to kill Cersei and to live instead, which is good in theory, except I no longer even know what her deal is or what's driving her decisions. Presumably she wants to survive and be with her family? But then after Bran becomes king, she bails on her family again! What the hell, Arya? What are you even doing? What does this character value, what does she want? She harps on about family but clearly doesn't give a shit about them. She comes off as hypocritical and basically crazy.
she's perfectly normal and well adjusted.  she should be a traumatized, ptsd ridden mess, a sadistic mass murderer hell bent on revenge with little humanity left.
I liked Arya a lot up until Season 5. She *was* my favorite character. But then they 1) shipped her off to Braavos for almost 2 seasons and separated her from every other character, 2) had her survive getting stabbed in the belly and getting sewage poo in her tummy because why not, 3) had her come back to Westeros, murder people and cook them into a pie totally casually, 4) had her kill the Freys and escape with absolutely no consequences and no effect on the narrative whatsoever, 5) had her kill the Night King because they needed it to happen I guess and there wasn't enough time to make it satisfying in any way or involve characters who actually had any storyline connected to him in any way, 6) made her mostly useless in Seasons 7/8 except for the Night King bit and 7) most importantly *sent her off to Braavos in the first place despite none of that really ever paying off.*\n\nI always told myself Arya had invincible plot armor because they sent her to Braavos and there was no way they would do that without bringing her back to make use of what she learned and have an impact on the main story (even her death in Braavos wouldn't affect anybody because most people didn't know she was there or that she was even still alive).\n\nWell, it turns out that was only half right - she did have plot armor, but they didn't seem to have any plans for her at all.\n\nAdmittedly Arya did some despicable stuff before Season 5 too but it was always interesting. For example, when she kills that stable boy in Season 1.
I had loved her character when the show began but started hating it afterwards (season 5 onwards).
Yeah that\u2019s easily the worst scene in GoT history only challenged by the Jaime/Bronn Dorne scenes. The difference is those scenes were forgettable and relatively unimportant. This scene is arguably the MOST important in the show and it\u2019s ALSO so poorly done
Why did the Unsullied let Jon and Tyrion live so long after Dany dies? It's been weeks and they were killing no-name Lannister soldiers for fun earlier. The guy who betrayed their queen and the guy who killed her get to live? Then they allow Tyrion to decide the king and Jon to go into exile, then up and leave. Additionally, the Dothraki seemingly merge with Westeros and live in King's Landing now (They weren't leaving on those ships) when they should be killing Jon then committing suicide as blood riders do.\n\nThe king decision scene was a huge load of BS. Arya threatens Yara with no effect, Sansa insults her uncle (an ally) for no reason which potentially cripple future relations and alliances, Tyrion picks Bran of all people because \"stories are important\" even though he seemingly doesn't mean all the stories Bran can tell but the story of Bran himself (which is a boring story at best), Bran basically announces he knew he'd be King which begs the question 'Did he allow this genocide and fallout?\", and then everyone unanimously agrees this creep they never met should be king based on the words of a traitor.\n\nPlus all the comedy they threw in in the moments after one of the most influential characters died. Plus the terrible small council scene that actually made no sense. How was Tyrion excluded from the history book? He was hand to 2 leaders, killed a hand, and is blamed for killing a king. Sam shouldn't be Grand Maester since he only got 1 or 2 links and didn't spend the years and years necessary at the citadel, it would make more sense for Brienne to be Sansa's Queensguard, and like you said Bronn being Master of Coin makes no sense. Tyrion should have had Bronn executed.\n\nI could probably go on but it's pointless, the shitshow is done and I'm exhausted.
To add on to what the other poster replied with...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJon's heritage wasn't even brought up in the final episode. Ultimately it just became a plot device for Daenerys even though it's a revelation that has world-changing consequences. Varys was even writing letters in Episode 5 and we only saw him burning the last letter he was writing... so unless we're going to fill in the plot whole for the writers the viewer is left to believe the rest of the letters were sent out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am overall pretty disappointed that Jon never got any conflict or development over his true parentage outside of his relationship with Daenerys, but at least that isn't a gaping plot hole like it's complete irrelevance in 8.06.
Watch pretty much ANY review of the episode on YouTube for the answer to your question.
Arya has done some seriously fucked up shit.  \n  \nMurdered a child whose only crime was pushing her \n  \nThreatened and showed off about murdering that child to another child  \n  \nViolently tortured and murdered many, many people  \n  \nMurdered and then hacked up the dead bodies of 2 men to then bake into a pie Hannibal Lector-style to serve to their father    \n  \nSlit the throats of prominent political figures  \n  \nMass poisoned an entire house\n  \nAnd worst of all, killed the saviour of the world, the one true king that could actually bring real peace to the land: the Night King. And in so doing, literally genocided an entire race from the world.  \n  \nArya makes Dany look like a Saint.  \n  \nAnd that little shit got to make a little judgey face about \"I know a killer when I see one\" and got to go Captain Jack Sparrow into the west...  \n  \nI hope a Kraken eats her
All of what you mentioned except for the genocide of the dead, are why I hated how people keep saying look at Dany's past and you can see she was gonna be the mad queen. Most of the characters in this show have done and threatened to do some fucked up shit
I fucking hate Arya stans
It would work better if her story is presented as a tragedy like it is in the books.
Casually threatens Yara to cut her throat too. This little shit got no respect since she has become the most overpowered character in the show.
I know that she was brutal and messed up, but she was also complex and compelling and that's why I loved the character. I never judge TV characters on how much I want to be their friend.
What child did she murder?
As opposed to the super-psychic  who has zero interest in ruling, knows nothing about leading anyone or running a kingdom, has zero social skills, and is so troubled he murdered an entire city and spent 2 seasons so emotionally crippled that he is unable to want at all.
Well I never said I like show Bran being on the throne either.
Honestly that is what I have hated lately.  Even the last 3, 4 seasons.  It is really cool to watch, but that isn't why I loved this show.  I remember back in season 1-4 they didnt even show the fight scenes.  They would just skip through and show the aftermath of it all with a few dead people on the ground.  Aside from a few 1 on 1 battles (Or something of the sorts) they did not show any fighting at all.    \n\n\nIt has turned into too much of a fighting/battle tv show and strayed from their roots of simply good character arcs, conflicts, politics and drama.
>fighting/battle tv show\n\nWhat the fuck fighting did you see? There was only Cleganebowl. It turned into more of a dumb shit happens and Tyrion says dumb shit type of TV show. If it was all battles it would've been much better.
That's pretty much my dad, never even watched season 1 and just watched the show because its popular. Unfortunately that's who it seems these last 2 seasons were catered too.
Who watches a show like this without starting from the beginning? Gross.
I don't think that's a fair summary in this case. A lot of the rage actually comes from these very people, many of whom were Dany stans who fully expected her to sit on the Throne and bring peace and prosperty to the galaxy, and issues of pacing aside could never imagine her doing anything bad.
The gatekeeping in this thread is fucking insipid hahaha
Book reader here, I'd rate the season a 9/10. Character arcs make sense to me, spectacle was amazing. Could've done with a couple more episodes but that doesn't make what was there less than a 9 IMO.
I really don't understand this. Only episode 5 was full of any spectacle at all. What are casual fans enjoying about this at all? Probably more than half the season is just Tyrion talking random nonsense that is supposed to sound smart. I feel like they did a fucking poor job of appealing to casual fans too, but they still liked it for some reason. They walked the line of like trying to be a smart well written show and being a casual fanservicey action packed romp and it woulda been better to just go full on in that direction instead of pretending to be something else.
Episode 3 had spectacle.
I don't even agree that the spectacle was great this season. Battle in episode 3 was too chaoti c. And dark to even see what was going on. The NK's death was about as lame as could be. I had no idea what was happening with the dragon fight in that episode. The epic fights this season were anything but epic. Compare cleganebowl to the hound vs. Brienne fight. The sacking of Kings Landing was basically just Dany flying around burning things. Compare that to the scene when she takes out the ships at slavers bay. Even the spectacle fell short this episode, partly, I think, because emotional investment in the characters was severely lacking this season after they decided to completely 180 everyone.
I really apreciate it now even more, that I have really loved the finale, after reading all that stupid butthurt comments.\n  I am not your opinion. So what?\n  Guess what, I found it genius! \n   I'm happy and satisfied, and I dont know, but I prefer to be NOT your opinion.
Yup, I think I forget that not everyone is like me (surprising I know)\n\nI hate TV. Haven\u2019t watch a single series of TV in years before GoT, but this show was different. And that\u2019s what I loved.\n\nA huge portion of the fan base watches all the random garbage on TNT and CBS and FX and whatever so GoT is just another night they have plunked in front of the tube.\n\nAnd for those people it was great. Another piece of eye candy they could use to waste the time between work and sleep. All my friends on Facebook who liked the final season fit that description to a tee.
Whatever random CBS TNT FX shows you are thinking are simply better than this season, that's the crazy part. People will still say this season was better because it had well designed dragons and costumes and shit, but a fucking Big Bang Theory episode is way more logically and tonally consistent than this season.
Nope, I listen to a radio show daily that\u2019s decided they were going to talk about GoT while it was on. And they did a TERRIBLE job. Not knowing literally anyone\u2019s names except for Jon and \u201cDany\u201d\n\nAnd they were upset at all the people who didn\u2019t like the finale. They couldn\u2019t even mention Arya by name, just that she was the little assassin girl. Yet they thought the fandom was over reacting
Some people still seem to think Daenerys' name is Khaleesi.
i overheard someone on the bus say that people only dislike it because the show is ending and it made the most sense that 'wheelchair kid' would be leader. They also said dany was 100% alive and warged into her dragon
Ok but hang on that sounds really cool
Maybe a lot of them, but a guy on a forum I visit has been watching since S1 aired, and has read all the books, and he loved season 8. I'm baffled by it too, to be honest, but there we go. There are legitimate fans who weren't disappointed and we probably shouldn't be snobby and dismissive of everyone.
\"if you liked the show you're a casual\"\n\nimagine being this insufferable
They really are casual thou. Not that there's anything wrong with liking things casually but don't complain when people have valid criticism. Like how can anyone be okay with the ironborn and Dorneish just accepting a new king while the north goes free? The same ironborn who rebelled just 7 years ago for their own independence is now blindly loyal to a dead queen who they only fought for because she promised them independence aren't seizing this chance to be free? Or the Dorneish who have defyed Targaryen rule for 200 years just go along with a new king? Stuff like this is happening constantly on the show these past seasons and I can't see how anyone truely immersed in the story wouldn't be tired of having to constantly ignore what the characters were saying to enjoy the show, especially when this show was initially built off the wonderful characters and not constant Micheal bay action scenes.
/r/gatekeeping ?
If the only requirement to get through that gate is naming 5 main characters, after 8 seasons, that's a gate im willing to keep till I die
There's definitely a certain group this season aimed to please, and dismissing those people as \"not true fans\" is stupid. Let people enjoy things.
No one is stopping anyone from enjoying anything.
No. I read all the books twice, watched the series 3 times, and as flawed as season 8 was, I still loved it. I still do, despite what's happening in this thread.\n\nI've been kind of depressed all week though, had some deaths in the family and coming on here compounds that. My GF and I both really liked a lot of the season, the knighting of Brienne, Dany turning into her father, Jon ultimately deciding to abandon his honor, his title, and love for what's right, Drogon destroying the throne. Tyrion throwing out the family monarchy in favor of a voting system was a great step towards democracy and what I always imagined Tyrion's character would offer the world. The coming together of all characters to fight a common battle, drinking together post-battle. Fitting, sad deaths of Theon, Jorah, Edd. The cinematography and music were beautiful, the acting fantastic. There were writing issues that have been talked about ad naseum here, but it wasn't enough to bring down the culmination of it all for me.\n\nSo yes, it's true, I loved it despite its flaws. No, it's not the best in the series. But it ended it well for me and I was massively entertained.\n\nBut like I said, people claiming that if I liked it I \"can't name more than five characters\"... this is just too much for me guys. I might have to stop reading here.
Idk, I could name every main character and 90-95% of every named character, and I thought the ending was alright.  I wouldn't say it's amazing, but the people who are calling it shit seem like the people who would have been mad at every single ending unless it was the one ending they wanted to happen.  And the people who are calling it disappointing probably held D&D to GRRM's standards, which was never going to happen.  Not even GRRM can finish his own books to his standards in ten years, and they expected D&D to do it in two?  There were things I wish were fleshed out more, but for the most part, I thought the end was explained well enough that I could fill in gaps/missing scenes and conversations.  And logically, the plot made sense and was built up well enough for me to accept.  I don't know why people are complaining that Dany going mad came out of nowhere.  She's been this way since the beginning and has always had advisors caution her, and push for mercy.  Without them, no one's there to advise mercy, and we get King's Landing.  On the death of the NK, I'm fine with Arya killing him too.  Yeah, it would have made complete sense for Jon to do it, but I know that if he did, people would have complained that it followed the fantasy trope.  Too many differenct fans, someone will always complain.  People just held season 8 to a higher standard and forgot about the shortcomings in prior episodes.  They've hyped the ending in their own heads for two years, so when they didn't get what they want, they complain on the internet.
Wat. \n\nYou think the rightful heir to the throne who killed a person who just torched an entire city of innocents should be sent to a wall for life to protect the kingdom from the guys they destroyed in episode 3? Meanwhile, they let a little guy who is on trial for treason basically make the most important decision the Kingdom will make for centuries? And then they pick a guy who hasn\u2019t said a fucking thing for a couple seasons. That same guy got a bunch of \u201caye\u2019s\u201d from house leaders who wouldn\u2019t even know who bran was, or much less why he\u2019s fit to be king. Bran says earlier that he can never be lord of anything, but now he\u2019s king. He also says he\u2019s come all this way to be king, so basically he knew Dany was going to killed a few hundred thousand innocents and just let it happen. \n\nYou\u2019re totally cool with Bran gaining all these powers and then just ghosting for the battle with the dead? And you\u2019re also fine with the White Walkers targeting Bran for some unknown reason even though he clearly doesn\u2019t do anything? You\u2019re cool with the White Walkers obviously having some intelligence and motive, but then their story is over before we even understand anything about them? Why were they targeting encyclopedia instead of the A10 Warthogs? \n\nYou\u2019re cool with Arya getting some crazy powers in order to make pies out of tertiary characters and then never use them again? \n\nThere\u2019s easily another season worth of story to wrap up/explain. You could easily make two seasons without it feel like it\u2019s dragging on.
They got weird ass names. I\u2019ve watched the show since the start and am doing my second re-watch and I still don\u2019t know half the characters names. (I\u2019m not one that thought the last two seasons were any good though) \n\u201cYo that\u2019s that bad dude that fucks with magic and green shit!\u201d \u201cYo that\u2019s that dude that sounds like he\u2019s coughing up phlegm when he says his name\u201d. \u201cYo, \u201ccool uncle\u201d shitty jack Sparrow is on!\u201d That\u2019s how I remember the characters.
Casual
You selfrighteos fucks\n\n   Jesus.
That is pretty much me. I don't look too hard at shows and just like it based on how it made me feel. I thought for the most part season 8 was really good, but even I had problems with the last episode.
Except if you don\u2019t care about those 2 things then what do you care about? Action? Because this episode had none. Characters? Because none of them made sense.\n\nThe only people who I could see genuinely enjoying that episode are fans of Bran or people who only watch the series because it\u2019s \u201ctrendy\u201d but have never actually seen an episode before season 6. And I doubt that makes up 10% of this subreddit.\n\nNo, I\u2019m almost completely positive the \u201cAmazing (9.9)\u201d people were only trying to skew the ratings system because they new that so many people were going to crush this episode.
Some people don\u2019t nitpick. As a book reader before the TV series was announced I understand that there are some holes and that not everyone is happy, but I\u2019m sure that I\u2019m not the only one who thought, \u201cwow that was really incredible to have been a part of all this and goddamn what an ending\u201d
They are.\n\nDoesn't mean I can't scratch my head, questioning as to how they came to that opinion.
If I said Scary Movie 5 was the greatest film ever made I\u2019d hope someone would show up and question my opinion. \n\nJust because something is subjective doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be head scratching
[deleted]
Doesn't mean some opinions aren't wrong.
Yeah, but is that reaction really that bad?\n\nIt'd be like 'oh whoa, you support the pro-life bill?' type of realization.
Comparing liking an episode of a TV show to supporting a bill that requires children to bear their rapist's babies. This is some peak /r/gameofthrones shit.
There's no way edmure joins sansa after that
There's a reason he sat down, and that's because he's already subservient to her. If he had to choose between joining his boss-niece Sansa or the people who kept him captive all this time, the Lannisters, of course he'd choose Sansa. Her being rude once is not enough to convince a kingdom to abandon their allies and join their enemies.
LOL it\u2019s a rolling commode!
I\u2019m sure he attempts to jerk off at times. Who knows it\u2019s just hard to take Bran serious
I guess I was in completely different sub full of fanart and cosplay like the off-season and \"unpopular opinion: I liked it\" x100 silver, x1000 gold, x10000 plat. \nAll the fun community left this sub a long time ago.
Have you been in a single episode thread? Post-episode thread? Survey thread? Any of the dozens of \u201cthis made no sense and here\u2019s why\u201d threads? \n\nSure this sub isn\u2019t as critical as r/asoiaf and turned on the writers later but this sub has been complaining non-stop since Episode 4 at least.
bruh what? this sub has been nothing but whinging and the few posts that do say \"I liked it\" get immediately shit on in the comments
This sub isn't r/asoiaf (which really all it does is complain) but it certainly has a lot of defenders. Until 8.06 the last few episodes have had at least two threads simply stating how they like the episode and it becomes a well-liked gilded thread (including one that asked for no negativity and just positive comments):\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bnxnib/spoilers\\_unpopular\\_opinion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bnxnib/spoilers_unpopular_opinion/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is one of the more recent ones I can easily find (I am not investing time to hunt down the rest). I've even seen genuine complaints get constantly written off as haters, people who aren't paying attention, people who should not watch the show anymore, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis sub certainly has gotten negative, but it's not as if there aren't a lot of positive posts either. If it was positive in past seasons and turned negative in this most recent one that is very telling of season 8.
Now *there's* a show that knows how to end right. They're so good at series finales, they made three!
Agreed. I\u2019m ok with all of the major plot points of season 8, just not the execution.
100% agree. I\u2019m just so happy for them they made it
Even as a Sansa fan I found literally all of the rest of it unsatisfying
If anything, it should be worse. My wife and I started the show 4 weeks ago with no spoilers. We clearly saw pacing and writing inconsistencies starting at around the end of season 6 whenever Arya gets stabbed like 4 times and survives and heals in a night. From then on, plot armor and shitty pacing was very obvious since the previous seasons were literally only days apart to us watching.
Yep. This isn't just book readers nitpicking about their favorite theories not coming to fruition. It was a fundamental failure of storytelling. My mother, my sister, and the guys at the barber shop I go to are all show-only people, and they were all bitterly disappointed, and could clearly articulate the problems with the past two seasons' narratives, character issues, and logic.
watching the dorne plot was very jarring.  everything was just completely off.  characters were no longer coherent, and the plot was just...
> My wife and I started the show 4 weeks ago with no spoilers. \n\nMajor props to your epic binge.
I'm a big stan of Sansa and still found this season disappointing, and episode 6 was extremely underwhelming and frustrating for me.
I just lowered my expectations after season 6 and a bit more after season 7. So it was difficult to be disappointed. Also a bit of a Sansa fan.
The show has been up and down for a few seasons now in my opinion. I liked some episodes this season and disliked some others. I thought that the ending felt rushed and a bit confusing, but at the same time I also don't think that any possible ending would have been good enough for me. So I'm a bit forgiving.\n\nAlso, I loved the Long Night. I'm probably a minority in that.
That sub is where you go when you want to ignore the problems this season had, those people legit think this season was absolutely amazing and there is no constructive discussions where they point out issues and if you attempt to voice your opinion that the writing is bad - they say you are just a sheep. Ironically, they have a sheep mentality that this season was actually good - stray to far from the herd and you get hated on.
I've seen the most meaningful discussions (and criticisms) of S8 so far down in the comments on that sub. Unlike others which are just a hate wagon.
I'm not really making any conclusions. I just think it is interesting. I personally saw some leaks by accident and I think it affected the experience. The leaks I saw out of context were really dumb, and when it actually happened it was a bit frustrating.
Yea I meant to reply to the guy that replied to you. Sorry.
> the things the Hound told her before he fought the Mountain were exactly what most people were thinking\n\nBut did those even make sense? He was trying to tell her that she has to be careful and shouldn't let vengeance consume her, but she already murdered a family and baked them into pies to feed to their father out of revenge. \n\nLike, vengeance already has her, and for one person saying \"nah but what if you didnt?\" to just change her entire life made no sense.
I liked the opening sequence and the credits after D&Ds name went away
When the best parts of Game of Thrones are the ones without dialogue, something went wrong
> I disagree with the concept that a popular character should prevail at the end of the story. It's exactly the opposite of what GRRM's story is based upon.\n\nCharacters are usually popular because they are interesting though. What has happened here is a boring character which the audience is not particularly invested in has been put on the throne instead of one anyone enjoys watching. An interesting character getting the throne would have been much better, whether that is a character who is good or bad or likely or unlikely to sit the throne.
You are using different words to say the same thing: you'd much rather have someone that the public loves be the final winner.\n\nThis is not how the story works, it has been established since Season 1 and it's one of the main reasons it's such a good story
Bronn's whole story this season was such a giant mess.
Yeah I think they absolutely wasted him
are you Dan or Dan? You just keep defending this pile of horseshit all over the place...
I didn't like many things about this season. This doesn't mean the story is a pile of horseshit.
Yeah, I get people having issues with the execution of the finale. I agree with that. It felt really rushed and they should probably have done another season if they wanted to wrap things up the way they did. This show used to be slow paced and intriguing, not an action novel.\n\nSo I get that complaint. What I don't get is how a lot of complaints boil down to \"things didn't go the way I wanted to\", which sort of has been the trademark of the show from the start. I have to admit that I do think that Bran isn't the most interesting character, but I also think that he mostly just suffered from the rushed execution and the fact that his story arc has been a bit of an irrelevant mess until the last few episodes.\n\nThey tried to make him a bit more interesting and relevant these last few episodes, but it was wasted effort because he simply had been so irrelevant to the main storyline for so long and a few episodes of screentime isn't going to change that. So again, the story really could have worked well if they would have taken their time with it.
Sure that played a part, but if you deny that Tyrion saying those words him were very helpful in convincing Jon, then you weren't paying attention. And regardless, it was still a great callback to S1.
It really went from bad to worse didn't it.\n\nSeason 7 writing \n\n1. Stupid idea to go on wight hunt and lose a dragon to the night king\n2. Loads of pregnancy related breadcrumbs for all of them to be entirely pointless at the end\n3. Littlefinger plot and the whole fake Arya and Sansa bickerings\n4. Bran returned only to become a zombie tree man with no sharing of any of the information - what good was it for him to have all that free internet bandwidth with no use to anyone. It is still literally unbelievable that NK came only for Bran\n\nSeason 8 - well there are probably 10-12 things wrong which I am not going to list and all of them are worse than the season 7 ones
The Arya and Sansa bickerings weren't fake.
Yeah, which is why I'm okay with it. I think that whatever ending the show would have had, it wouldn't have been satisfying. Except maybe an open ending. I can't think of any big show ending that was celebrated, except for Breaking Bad.\n\nIt's a bit dissappointing that they rushed it so bad that it became confusing. I think that to wrap it up like they did, they had to spend way more time developing the story arcs rather than changing characters seemingly at will. Still, it's been one of the best shows I've ever watched and a lesser ending isn't going to change that.
They are not trolling. The ppl that gave this episode a 10, just gave every other episode a 10. Consistency and some questionable intelligence.
So, they turned the wheel on its side? Now instead of a wheel that crushes the peasants under its rim as great houses fight to be on top, now it is a merry-go-round that is driven by political machinations? A pretty courtly political dance far above the heads of the common folk?\n\nBecause I could buy that if they didn't skip over all the political dealings and ramifications.
It\u2019s an improvement from before, Rome wasn\u2019t built in one day. If they installed a democracy I would have shut off the tv before the episode ended. This takes place in medieval times. Democracy didn\u2019t come about until hundred of years later.. it\u2019s a process
They still do. \n\nA Stark is in charge with a Lannister and a Tarly serving on his council. The Greyjoys, Martell, Arryn and Baratheon families are all still in charge of their respective territory. On top of that, the Stark family is also in charge of their own independent kingdom. \n\nAll of these families will give their titles down through their families and no other way. Exception of this is the actual throne since Bran can't have an heir, so yeah, bloodshed awaiting.\n\nDon't give me the whole \"they did it for the realm\", Sam proposed an elective monarchy and it became clear that they laughed at the idea of letting go of their positions of power. They propped up one of theirs (member of a rich and powerful family) to assure the benefit of their own interests.
A big bad an episode, till no one is left but Tormund and Ghost, because they could never be big bads.
He was amazing in bodyguard

Thank you for this comment, really brought up my mood.
Damn Arya ruined pies for me, now thats the first thing I think about whenever someone mentions pies.
also possibly true, agreed
Maybe I sounded that way which was not my intention. I just wanted to point out that 1 is too unfair. Anyways, I agree with your main argument I should not generalize or try to guess people's reasoning. I am a bit sad about all the people involved and their effort.
if you got an average person and made them use more than about 40% of their attention to watch this series all the way through, you have to be borderline challenged to rate it a 7 or above. either that or you are a delusional peter pan child who thinks everything is wonderful and negativity is bad.
\"So Dorne and The Iron Islands don't want to secede despite Dorne being really high-up in authority, and Yara literally only joining Daenerys under the concession of independence?\"\n\n\"Huh, Arya killing Green Eyes didn't pan out huh?\" \n\n\"Bran Stark, the guy who didn't want to be Lord of Winterfell, hasn't had his powers explained and hasn't warged into anything or done anything of importance is now King and done nothing to earn it outside of being 'magical bait', which isn't even all his doing (NK marked him)? The guy who literally got carried everywhere cause of his bum legs?'\n\n\"Why does Tyrion get to talk and tell them choose a leader if he's a prisoner?\"\n\n\"So Jon's Targaryen ancestry boils down to riding Rhaegal in one battle, and fucking up his relationship with Daenerys? Not even a contender for the throne with no one battling to save him? Like he was stripped of his titles. He didn't even come up for nomination.\"\n\n\"Why did Drogon burn the throne and carry of Daenerys body?\"\n\n\"How did Bronn become Lord of Highgarden. How does a common cut-throat become leader over countless other houses when he doesn't know how to read or write.\"\n\n\"Why is there a Night's Watch, or was that a farce. Are Yara and Dorne angry and going to upkeep a watch on Jon, or is he literally okay if Greyworm fucks off? What is this.\"\n\n\"Greyworm, you're going to the place with flesh-eatting butterflies.\"\n\n\"So expanding on this; Tyrion basically fucks up everything for Daenerys, and then gets her killed and is now Hand of the King again? What a punishment. /s.  This is the guy who after realizing Varys was right commented how Varys was going to tell him 'I told you so', over 'Wow I killed my best friend over nothing.' How did Tyrion become fucking judge, jury, and executioner at his own trial.\"\n\n\"So I get the whole system change, which will still probably lead to fighting cause system changes do that, but Daenerys infertility was an issue, and Bran's is a virtue. Kinda an odd feeling juxtaposition. Nitpick here though.\"\n\n\"Arya trained with faceless assassins and only used her magical face skills ONE TIME in Westeros.  Not to kill Cersei, not against the Night King, not against Daenerys, not against Sansa or Littlefinger. Against Walder Frey and his house. Wow.\"\n\n\"Writing is a magical thing that can make anything work and be powerful. But tell me, do people believe in Jon and Daenery's romance?  Now let's say Jon tried to kill Daenerys but got detained by guards that Daenerys is missing in her scene for some reason. What if Jorah Mormont had lived and Daenerys had gone crazy? How would it have felt if Jorah had killed her instead? Died to dragonfire after?  That would've been fucking heartbreaking. And it would've totally killed the dumb [lover must kill lover] trope. Could even have Jon drop Longclaw. Jon and Daenery didn't have chemistry or the time to make it happen. Jorah and Daenerys did, eight seasons worth.\"
> you have to be borderline challenged to rate it a 7 or above\n\nBro, you had a chance to clarify it was an exaggeration, yet here you are doubling down and literally calling people borderline mentally challenged for liking this season.\n\nI'm going to assume there's not a single show or film that you like or think is good, otherwise I get to call you mentally challenged. See how this works?
mate it has 4 upvotes and every single reply is hating on it.
got technically worse by number... see any score for rt, imdb..lol
I mean he disappeared off into the wilderness where he will definitely be chopping trees down at some point. Too close to being a lumberjack for comfort.
Well, you feed people to dogs for fun so I don't know if I trust your opinion.
At least we dont practice incest
Right, but Dany's followers might have been cool with it if they found out Jon's true identity??? Guess we will never know...
you want a pat on the back for hating it? seems like most people on the sub do.
[deleted]
If you hated It so much why are you wasting your time discussing It on the internet with strangers. You didn\u2019t hate It, It just didn\u2019t meet the same standard of quality as seasons 1-5. \n\nI think everyone is confusing hate for the last season with disappointment.
It's true even if they downvote
Better than expected? Yes\n\nGood? Definitely not
Yeah i've been defending this show all season but the finale was indefensible imo i think they tried to curveball everyone but went too far
I do kinda see his point, and I've never even tried cocaine.
So you're saying more people really liked it than hated it? ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)
Ok but that is cherry picking to fit your narrative. Why did you not choose 1-2 and 9-10? Because it doesn't fit your narrative.
I ran the descriptive statistics on the data set and the distribution is negatively skewed. So that's not cherry picked data, and it does end up fitting my narrative. Happy?
That is not how numbers work. There are more 1s than 10s. Remove extremes and you get a 5.9. I'm not here arguing it was good, just the hypocrisy going around here.
... Read those sections
Oh, yeah. Definitely rushed.\n\nThe fact that the very things that drew me into the show (Whitewalkers) were decimated in a single episode was upsetting.
Fckin Bron. His plot was stupid and lazy as shit. Like Brienne and Tormund they just kept him around for fan service at the end. I hated it. \n\nCan't wait for Greyworm to die from the butterfly disease in Naarth.
Some of the conversations were very private, it's not like Littlefinger bugged the place
Thats just poor writing.
Well the Night's Watch doesn't actually exist anymore so I guess he's got nothing else to do. \nI mean there's a huge hole in the Wall and Jon literally told the Wildlings they're welcome to come thru anytime (not to mention there's only about a hundred of them left so)
I could believe that Drogon just turned his head and the throne was in the way. He didn't burn Jon because he smelt of Targyreon, the throne was the next thing in his sight. An accidental irony. There's so much stupid stuff much worse that I'm going to let them get away with this one.
I could maybe buy that but he charges up and hits it again to really smother it which makes that reading way too generous
Nothing bothers people on this sub. They probably don't see any problem in the *council* scene.

Yeah, this sub. What a bunch of mindless plebs who have no understanding of cinematic elements? \n\nI thumb my nose at these people.\n\n/s
Ah. Thanks.
Exactly. People dont know we had the finale spoilers for months. Except nobody believed them because it sounded terrible. We thought there was no way D&D would air such garbage on HBO
And having this idea out there will affect perception. As you realize the leaks are true you are thinking about that and your preformed judgment instead of just taking it in for the first time.
because it was
Does that mean you didn\u2019t like a single thing about this episode?
It was the first episode that I wanted to finish as fast as possible because I started to get bored and stop caring. Eventhough, I liked the first 20-30 minutes, the directing and ridiculous situations the characters got themselves in (Tyrion literally being able to exacavate his brother and sister...) just took me out of the episode. Also, the second part was HORRIBLE it felt like a comedy!
Episode was boring and no I didn\u2019t like a single thing about it
A Single thing wouldn\u2019t even grant a 1/10. a ninety minute episode that\u2019s close to perfect is a nine, but if I honestly enjoyed just about five minutes and thought the dragon looks cool that\u2019s not a five, is it? I think I rated it about 4 or 5, but after a couple of days i feel worse about it.
Well that\u2019s idiotic
I actually though episode 6 made episode 5 way better because it made Dany\u2019s \u201cmad\u201d moment a little more understandable, but that\u2019s just me I guess.
Awesome how her victory lasted 20 minutes at most right
[deleted]
I hated this season but good god you're like all the worst parts of the internet in a single person.
That's what is mind blowing.  Even fan fiction is so much better than what we got.
r/asoiafcirclejerk
Im serious
Jon became pretty great, until this season when he was basically a lackey.
Yeah I agree. Jon became obsessed with honor and brooding, Arya obsessed with being a bad ass, and Sansa with power.
Not like there\u2019s many excellent arguments on this sub anyways
Sleepy? \n\n  I dont even know what to respond to that.\n\n  No?\n  I mean sure scenes were clearly stretched, particularly the one in the throne room. But sleepy?
I dont care, at least I am happy GoT fanboy, and you are bitter
Aren't they the producers and writers of the show since day one, since eleven years?
You know there is a saga of books called *A song of ice and fire* right?
Yeah.. I\u2019m down with the ending. But like if your going to put a monotoned 17 year old, that displays absolutely no emotion, creeps out everyone he comes into contact with, in the highest seat of power, you gotta leave some breadcrumbs for the people. You. Just. Gotta. \n\nDany went mad fine. We could have gotta over that one. Bran the one true king? No, that\u2019s not gunna fly, we need answers.
I used to defend it thinking they had to get all their pieces in place to set up for season 8.  Turns out they rushed season 7 so they could rush season 8 and finish be done with it once and for all.
I fucking hate what they did with Bran. He has explicitly stated that he cannot be Lord of Winterfell because he is the Three Eyed Raven now. He even said he\u2019s not even really a man. He made a bid deal about telling Jon his true heritage. Now all the sudden he wants to be King? He probably knew exactly what was going to happen with Danaerys and he said nothing. Fuck Bran and fuck these terrible writers.
If he had known, I wouldn\u2019t even be pissed. I mean if they spent the season showing bits that didn\u2019t make sense and left you questioning what bran was doing for it all to be revealed at the end. That may have possibly been good. But he was basically useless these past 2 seasons.
> He probably knew exactly what was going to happen with Danaerys and he said nothing. Fuck Bran and fuck these terrible writers.\n\nI think that's implied pretty heavily with the dragon vision over King's Landing back season 6 or whatever it was. But yeah that almost means that Bran/3ER was the ultimate villain in the end. They let everything happen or even nudged small things to make it happen just so the 3ER could become king. Really not sure if i'm a big fan of that
They completely fucked up so many characters. Bran, Danerys, Euron (was a great character that they wasted) Cersei, Arya. The only person that D+D actually gave a good story arch is Theon.\nThey should have done a lot more with Bran, and Euron honestly.
He lied. And, he's not Bran.  They all got outmaneuvered by Bloodraven
Literally said he didn't want to be king to Tyrion as it happened.
Isn't Bran on the throne presumably how GRRM told them it would end though?
To be fair, had he said something, someone would have tried to kill her meaning Cersei would have won, or should the killing be unsuccessful Dany would have done it anyways.
A very strange piece of writing, imo. Could nearly end up with Bran being viewed as a sort of Machiavellian figure, which I'm not sure was the writers' intention, but just illustrates how poorly executed the whole thing was..
I viewed the whole thing differently. He didn't want to be king, but since he's the three eyed raven he already knew that he would become king, so he did it to fulfill his destinay. Why was he chosen? Well that's sort of a paradox
I'd be interested to see a one off feature length episode showing what Westeros looks like in 100 years. With Bran being so passive and allowing so many disasters to happen, it would be interesting to see what he's like as a king. It would probably be like a HP Lovectaft story - eldritch being tricks everyone into making him king and goes on to turn his kingdom into a dystopian nightmare.
Where was the objection on religious grounds? Ebrose was writing a book but he wasn't at a grand council? Jim Broadbent didn't want to come back for one scene?\n\nHow can the septons have a different religion than the king without massive dissonance?
He doesn't want to be a king, but it was his responsibility to become one.\nBrans journey was to become a king which will lead Westeros to prosperity. He can see all previous king choices and consequences. He can see what happens in the world. And if he manages to grow weirwood, then he will be able to live long enough to give away his title for democracy.
Bran will be king in the books too.
Fucking writers!
Bran is very likely going to be king in the Books too. You calling GRRM terrible too?
Poorly written
That really grinds my gears. Literally 4 episodes before that he was talking about how he doesn\u2019t want to be Lord of anything. I feel like that was intentional misdirect by the writers, who again went for shock value versus logic
Plot twist. Bran/The Three eyed Raven learns to warg into Drogon and now that he has control of The Prince That Was Promised/The Stallion Who Mounts the World, cleanses the world by setting it afire, in the name of the Lord of Light. The Night King never wanted to end humanity. He wanted to stop the Three Eyed Raven from going on a rampage. People kept getting in the way, damnit!\n\nSEASON 9 CONFIRMED! GET HYPE!
Fantastic. You\u2019re hired
*\"One side's villain is the other side's hero.\"*
I still think they meant it as an upbeat line from him. I bet they just wanted to convey that he came all the way from kings landing, but the implication to the audience is that his whole journey and everything the realms went through was to get him on the throne.\n\nAnother victim of writing. Unless they intended it to make people think. Which could be the case, but than I'd argue they fumbled that. Cause it just warrants a \"H\u00e9? What the fuck?\"
I dunno, to me the line \"Why do you think I came all this way?\" implies prior knowledge. And he shouldn't be joking anymore anyways because he doesn't feel and isn't Bran anymore. Or is he? We will never know, because it flips and flops back and forth.
They clearly didn\u2019t realize how it sounded/looked in context\n\nNo surprise cause they suck
He said is like a sitcom joke. And then everyone chuckled, like, \"oh, Bran.\" The show acted like it was a funny aside, and didn't seem to understand the chilling implications of this statement.
It doesn\u2019t really matter either way tho, the implication is still the same that he knew he was going to be chosen.
As I said countless times since this \"sh\\*t\" happened, Bran was either the true villain of the story or a f\\*cking nobody that shouldn't get the throne/didn't deserve the throne (because of horrible character arc and lack of any personal connection to the throne).
>  bet they just wanted to convey that he came all the way from kings landing\n\nI really don't think this was what they were going for. It sounded like a *Everthing I did since season 6 was for this*
I heard that line and thought what you thought they intended, not the entire path of everything he's done.
You make great points about Bran, but everything you\u2019ve said is all examples that Brandon Stark did die when he became the 3ER.  We\u2019re still left trying to understand what the 3ER wanted exactly,  but it\u2019s safe to say he was after the Throne. He can see all possible futures and what better way to possibly end up on the Throne than through a Stark.  Is he a villain that just wants control or did the 3ER want to end tyranny as well? I do wish the story could have filled in the missing pieces,  but I think the first step in understanding it is that Bran is not sitting on the Throne it is the 3ER.
Yeah one of my biggest issues was not giving a single fuck about White Walker/CotF/3ER lore in the final two seasons
At least in the books, Bran is turning into a monster.  Jon, who has powers in the books, gets a lesson that basically amounts to a lesson in how to not be an evil wizard.  Bran is checking every box.  What he does to Hodor is an abomination in the books and pretty explicitly meant to be magical rape.  Bran knows it is wrong but does it constantly because it makes him feel good.  There are also worrying signs that he may be about to use Hodor to rape Meera.  He has also eaten human flesh both with his own hands and through his wolf.  Incidentally, Arya also murdered and ate a shepperd while dreaming in her wolf.
End tyranny after possibly manipulating Dany into killing everyone and giving access to the NK? LUL better luck next King :P In my opinion, he is the true villain of the story. Him and Dumb&Dumber. *So many plot holes :'(*
Why would Tyrion even back him!
I think we are absolutely led to believe that Bran's \"I don't want\" is sincere and that Varys (?) saying the best king is one who doesn't want it is a correct assessment. The end of the series is showing us the dawn of a new era and I think we are meant to believe in and embrace it. The king is innocent and all-knowing, the council is (with the exception of Bronn) made of people who only want the best for everyone, and the hereditary line of kingship is gone (which is what caused all this trouble in the first place.) I think theorizing that the 3ER was somehow a villain seizing control for nefarious purposes can be interesting but ultimately doesn't seem supported by anything and is not how we're supposed to interpret that ending. We can take this point at face-value.
I think Bran's arc never happened in the last seasons. He is not a mastermind strategist, he is someone who can see every moment happened in the past. Bran arc stopped with \"Hold the Door\" becoming the three eyes raven, a no human who has no interest in the humanity politics and only to preserve the world, nature and the order of things. Then, in episode 6 season 8 that status jumped directly to mastermind strategist who was always playing the game of the throne. There has been no arc, no sense, the directors didn't make bran develop into that direction. Seems like they just picked the one who was less likely to become king to shock audience because GoT always shocked audience, they thoight they could recreate shock as for example the \"Red Wedding\" did. \n\nOr maybe it was their goal since the start but they still wrote it awfully and this happened because they needed to rush it. They had 2 years to shoot so much footage and they even ended to waste those years by not being able to put those scenes together. \n\nFantastic acting. Fantastic CGI. Beautiful scenes if picked one by one. But it was all rushed, there is no real timeline between scenes they are just glued together. Lots of fanservice and Disney-like forced things. The ending season that a well written show like GoT  didn't deserve
His character had the most potential, I honestly hate how rushed this season was.
It seemed that him and Sansa manipulated Jon to get rid of Daenerys, take the fall, and allow both of them to get into power. At least that's the way the show presented it. \n\nBran gets to be King. \n\nSansa gets to rule an independent North. \n\nJon gets to...go live in Alabama
Aka the bransa conspiracy.
Bran's whole character has been terribly handled. Turned into an emotionless robot in the last 2 seasons, zero build up towards him becoming King and no real role in the WW arc & explaining his powers.\n\nAnd then they expected people to be ok with him becoming King and giving him lines like that? WTF
While I agree that it was a mediocre arc, I don't understand where you're getting this \"he neglected to do anything because he wanted power\" thing. He's reacted to every situation the same; He's never made an attempt to influence results in any way and he always tells people that they were where they were supposed to be regardless of the \"good\" or \"evil\" aspects about it. This felt like the same thing to me. Of course he knows when bad things are going to happen, but he's never attempted to prevent or help with one of them before, I don't understand why people expected him to all of a sudden.
Yeah and we never heard from Meera again. Like what was the point of that journey? What would Meera think about him being the fucking King.
He just fucking dumps Meera with next to no emotion and people still think this emotionless robot should be King.
I hate bran, completely not thrilled about him getting the throne. But I truly don't believe Bran played everyone to get throne. Martin's end game was for someone who does not process any desire for power, greed, and vengeance to sit on the throne. Bran is the only one who fits that category. However, its hard to say for certain because the writers did such a shitty job with Bran's character, we have no idea wtf is actually going on inside his head. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvidence to support Bran's complete loss of any \"wants\" as he described it to Tyrion is his convo with Jaime in the Godswood. Jaime asked why he didn't tell everyone the truth about his fall. Bran replied \"you won't be able to help in this fight if I let them murder you\". Bran has no desire for justice or vengeance for what was done to him. Therefore his decision making process is one that completely lacks all personal desires. Which often corrupts the mind. \n\nJaime being sentenced to death for his crimes against Bran would have been just for the starks and bran but not necessarily the benefit to the realm at that time.
He's been manipulating events the entire time most likely...they just cut the show waaaay to short to go into those details.
There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever Bran has been manipulating anything outside of his throwaway \u201cshy do you think I came all this way\u201d line. I agree he *could* be manipulating things, but that is never remotely explained or developed upon
Bran is actually just Littlefinger. Littlefinger became a faceless man ya know? Bet your expectations are subverted
I like to think when he yelled \"FATHER!\" at the Tower of Joy, it gave Ned the idea to adopt Jon.
Especially from a character who doesn't consider himself human anymore and has said he doesn't want.
Imagine, creating a genius of evil w/o realising it. I knew they were bad but this... This is next lvl. Its so baaaaad its almost art
What's sinister about it? He repeated that he doesn't want to be King 2 minutes later. He came all this way because he knew he would be chosen and was willing to take on that responsibility, that's all.
\n> What's sinister about it?\n\nBecause it briefly implies he was manipulating events the entire time.  \n\n> He came all this way because he knew he would be chosen and was willing to take on that responsibility, that's all.  \n\nSo lets ignore the fact his election makes less sense than the tuxedo football scene in *The Room* - The question everyone should be asking is Why? Why is he willing to take on this responsibility? His whole point was that he was not Bran Stark anymore and that he wouldn\u2019t be the lord or ruler of anything? Why does Bran give a shit? His whole plotline has been *explicitly* about the great threat of the NK and how \u201conly he can stop them\u201d. He has never been involved with the KL storyline and his character has never had anything to do with either wanting to rule the kingdoms (like Dany) or being elected to positions of power (like Jon).  \n\nI *guess* you could make the argument that was the point and the kingdoms needed and desired a different kind of ruler but that also makes no sense because 1) hardly anybody in the dragonpit meeting even knew who Bran was, let alone what the 3ER is, and 2) the thematic principles of S8 (as awful as they were) is that development doesn\u2019t really matter and you just end up back where you started. But this theme is also kicked out the window at the end (or at least that was the intention) with Bran as king (which made no sense) and a mostly low-born small council (which also made no sense).  \n\nI just don\u2019t get the point of Bran or the point of the final message? I guess the point of the final message is inherent impossible to grasp because the *how* of the final message makes no sense, but the purpose of Bran could\u2019ve at least been explained - but nope, we don\u2019t even get a tiny bit of explanation into Bran\u2019s ultimate motives
\"WE\" still don't know fuck all about Bran...\n\nThat's such a huge assumption by people who don't know much about the show...\n\nIf you know everything about time and space- if you have cosmic knowledge, all of reality is spoiled for you.  You'll always know where to be and when to be.  It's the point of the 3 Eyed Raven.  He is ALL history All memories and all knowing... He's lost all enjoyment and excitement of life because he knows EVERYTHING.\n\nThis is why he never moved when the Night King was approaching him.  He knows Arya will kill him.  He's not Bran, he's the 4th wall breaking viewer of the series.  Imagine being told ALL of the story of Game of Thrones--Now you're a character in the story.  You'd always know where to be, what to do, etc.\n\nJust because you don't comprehend a story doesn't mean your ignorance gets to be the deciding factor in something.\n\nYou. Know. Nothing.
Well I liked most of the arcs, even Brans for the most part
Wanting the throne and deserving the throne are very clearly shown as two separate things throughout the season. Bran isn\u2019t saying he came all this way because he wanted the throne the whole time, he came all this way cause he wants what\u2019s best for the realm and that\u2019s him being king
Okay fair point. But Bran has never shown any qualities that in the eyes of 99% of Westeros' inhabitants would make him deserving of throne
~~It's so 2000s action movie ending line~~ \n\nIt's so 2000s *straight-to-DVD* action movie ending line
It\u2019s so 2000 *made-for-tv* movie ending line
Obviously because he sees it as his duty and \"what must happen\" according to his knowledge. That doesn't mean he wants it ??? Yes the script was really bad at times, but so is this complaint
>letting hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians die\n\nThis implies that he could have done anything about it to  begin with. Do please tell. How could Bran have stopped any of those events from unfolding? Not defending the show, cuz it turned to shit, but this seems unfounded.
Bran didn't have to tell Jon about his true heritage. Also since Bran can probably see glimpses of the future, and also has infinite knowledge of the past why didn't he tell Dany to use the secrete passageway which Jaime used to send some elite soldiers to go kill Cersei? Not to mention Bran would know that Euron had equipped his fleet with a whole boat load of scorpions and could have saved her dragon. It looks to me like he subtly manipulated events to go his way, even though Dumb and Dumber probably didn't intend for that to be the case
And he even insisted multiple times before when others pointed out that he was the rightful Lord of Winterfell that the 3 Eyed Raven can't be a Lord.
Exactly
They apparently cut a scene that showed exactly that Arya or Sansa and Bran conversation.
I thought that him becoming the 3ER so quickly basically fried is brain in a way. Since he really wasn't ready to be the 3ER. Maybe the OG was ready. Idk, just how I interpreted it I guess.
This is how I see it. I mean, he was pushed to become the 3ER too soon because of his own mistake of letting the Night King touch him in his vision. Then, his most loyal friend (Hodor) had to be sacrificed so he could survive - and Bran was the reason he talked like a Pok\u00e9mon. Robo-Bran seemed to be more like a coping mechanism than a side effect of being the 3ER
That's what I thought too, but I think they should've just made him be like that for the rest of season 6 and the first bit of season 7, give him some time to come back to normal and have actual character development.  After all, he was still emotional when he plugged into the tree and learned about Jon when telling Meera \"I'm the three eyed raven now, I have to do this.\"\n\nBut then after that he's just \"beep boop \ud83d\udcdf \ud83e\udd16\". Pretty much ruined his character making him so boring and truly a disservice to Isaac H. Wright by giving nothing interesting to do for the rest of the series.
I think part of it is that the character is a lot harder to translate from book to screen than others. I think the showrunners lost investment in the story and they ended up not doing the work to translate the character well, so we got stuck with robo-Bran. Idk still stupid.
Or Moonboy for all I care. No way to learn that given the question that was asked.
I think it's safe to presume that Bran is nowhere near 'second-favorite Stark'.
oh!
Vegisexual
It's spelled vedgetabel, right?
Agreed, Ned was a great character. He really was the one to get everything rolling.\n\nSansa is also pretty aight, wish she had done anything in season 8 like actually contesting Dany after she murdered Kings Landing, probably would have made her my favorite.\n\nThe other Starks are aight to meh,\nJon and Arya are just huge Mary Sues with a shit ton of plot armor and both were kinda ruined by season 8. \nCait had less depth when compared to the books. \nRob has always been a rather minor character. \nRickon is a joke.\nBran is straight up a huge plot hole.
I think she needed to spell it out for Jon as he seemed to be a bit slow in season 8.
SHE IS MAH KWEEN
It's like he knows nothing
First rule of great screen-writing (by D&D): tell, don't show.
She also spent 8 out of 8 seasons murdering various people, but sharp catch by Arya there.
That was horrific writing. My friend and I actually laughed \u201clike no shit she\u2019s a genocidal maniac not a killer.\u201d
What did you expect? Good dialogue from the writers? Haven\u2019t you heard? They got better things to do now...
>Yeah and dany was insane, Jon was stupid, Geoffrey cruel, Tommen weak, Tywin ruthless.  Each characters qualities whether they be likable or not contributed to this amazing story.\n\nThank you! I never got the hate for Catelyn. She wasn't one of my favourites, but I really liked her. I don't know. Did she have some irritating moments? Yeah. And as you said, SO DO ALL THE CHARACTERS. Even Jon, for fuck's sake. And I don't see as much hate in those cases lol
dunno, she was irredeemable for me. Acted like a cunt towards Jon who didn't do anything and then betrayed Robb by releasing Jaime like a stupid cunt
So he has 1 thing to Bran at least since he could walk. That's good to know :P
The S7 and S8 trope of Tyrion blindly trusting Cersei at every turn just made no sense whatsoever. The dude knows better than anyone that she's a back-stabbing bitch mainly out for herself. What the hell made him think that she would risk thousands of her soldiers when she instead had the opportunity to have Daenerys Targaryen and her entire forces obliterated?\n\nThen again, her being back-stabbing also changes depending on whether it's convenient for the plot. She sends Bronn to have Tyrion executed with the same crossbow he killed Tywin with, but for some reason no one has explained to me yet, she doesn't immediately kill him, Dany and her advisors or Drogon when they're all in range for the dozens of scorpion bolts ready to fire at them at Missandei's execution.
Tyrion as a character had to explain the poor writing every time he said \"I made a mistake. I shouldn't have trusted Cersei. I thought she had something to fight for.\"
She tried to kill him. Did he forget? Like dafuq? That whole thing was huge and made him hate everyone in KL.
Cersei kind of forgot she wanted to kill Tyrion.
It's probably because she let Tyrion know that she is pregnant. Anyone watching the show knows that Cersei is COMPLETELY driven by her children.  \n\nWhether Cersei thought the NK would actually get to Kings Landing or not, Tyrion thought that she wouldn't risk letting her child be destroyed by the WW.
I think Tyrion's plan was to get the throne at the end. He was playing Machiavelli. I mean, why snitch on Varys? It seems like he was manipulating people to turn on each other except his siblings. If this is the case, the director failed horribly at portraying this. It just doesn't make any sense how the characters acted so stupidly in the end compared to the early seasons.
That entire fucking episode of \u2018walk and talk for 20 steps, then stop and poignantly look into the distance,\u2019 was such bullshit. People loved it at the time however.
It was pointless at the time, but I kept holding out hope that there would be some payoff down the line... But no...
The annoying thing is they didn't even need a Dragon to cross the wall. They could just walk around the pass on the western side of it.
>It was pretty clear that the writers knew they wanted the NK to have a dragon.\n\nIf they only wanted NK to have a dragon they could have found a dead *somewhere* for him to raise.
>Cersei made it seems like she would be convinced?\n\nRemind me to murder the inventor of the withheld information trope. And the [Unspoken Plan Guarantee](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee) trope. I hate them with a vengeance and classify them as \"How to give dramatic revelations a half-hearted attempt by being vague.\"
If you think about it these  guys are rich and all they have to do is find a creative way to give the NK a dragon.\nAnd thats what they come up with.
I'd say losing only half your forces against a neverending army of the undead is a pretty good score.
This will also happen
Maybe add some rank-order questions instead of absolute or check all that apply questions. \n\nFor worst decision, maybe have us rank order a list, e.g., (1. Jon et al trying to capture a wight 2. Ned trusting little finger/warning Cersei beforehand 3. Dany listening to Tyrion about Cersei/not going off to burn the iron fleet/not attacking KL/anything 4. Queen Cersei choosing to not have at least one child by Bobby B 5. Robb agreeing to marry a Frey girl and then reneging 6. Oberyn not finishing off the Mountain/standing too close while interrogating him) \n\nDefinitely re-ask the who should\u2019ve died question with almost all of the characters sill alive (J, S, A, B, T, ST, G, P, Bron, BoT) and use rank-order. Same with who do you wish had lived longer or to the end. \n\nFor rank-order Qs you can analyze them by assigning point values for each rank then averaging across users: 1=10 pts, 2=9 pts ... (or how ever many options you list 1=5 pts, 2=4 pts). \n\nGreat job on these btw!
The idea of starting a rewatch and knowing that is going to be the end just puts me off.
Ah, I was saying that because almost none of the characters got the ending in his arc. For example, all the scenes of Arya being obsessed with Cersei, all the scenes of the NK vs Jon Snow stare-off, etc. They have no meaning in the \"end game\", so I lost my interest to all of them.
I just think he\u2019s so honorable he wont go back to Winterfell just to show he accepts the decision. Which is completely stupid. Futhermore, they dont need a nights watch anymore.
Right? The white walkers are dead and the wildlings are friends, what the fuck are they guarding against now?
That's the point I think
Yes Sansa is a Queen and can pardon him or give him sanctuary
Everyone seems to miss the fact that the whole point of this was to break the wheel and that can't be done by going back on deals. Jon is exiled. If he just goes to chill at Winterfell and Dany's remnant finds out, they march on Winterfell. The Ironborn join them. Does Bran, who isn't even Bran, send his armies to aid his family, even though they subverted an official sentence? Would that not make them enemies of Kings Landing? Bran won't give a shit but the other Lords might not appreciate the North having free reign to do whatever they want.\n\nKeeping Jon in exile, while sucky, blocks events that could spiral into new wars, and then where the fuck are we? Right back to the Game.
That works well if all of Danny's remaining supporters weren't on a boat heading for Naath before Jon even left king's landing
Yeah but D&D are going to subvert expectations and ruin it *more*
Honestly? I think Star Wars would be perfect for them. They chose cisual spectacles over story this season on Thrones, and I think that would suit Star Wars fairly well
It was interesting until he returned to castle black. From that point forward he just sat around doing nothing except saying something creepy once an episode.
Meera fans represent.
Osha as well
Why were they not at the council along with whatever lady is currently head of house Frey, and all the other nobles houses
I agree the end of Bran's story was dumb and pointless, but his journey has been the most interesting and intriguing to me through out the show - just to show a different opinion
Honestly, it always bored me personally - I just didn't find it or him interesting, and when he came back after being absent from Season 5 I just didn't care at all anymore.
Seriously, it's like that in Itchy and Scratchy episode 2F09, when Itchy plays Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone, he strikes the same rib in succession, yet he produces two clearly different tones. I mean, what are we to believe, that this is a magic xylophone, or something? Ha ha, boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.
I guess it\u2019s just me, but I read that as \u201che came all this way\u201d because he knew he had to be king in order to \u201cbreak the wheel\u201d. Idk maybe I\u2019m giving them too much credit, but I actually like the Bran on the throne decision. What I can\u2019t agree with, is the lack of a natural storyline to get there. Like they should\u2019ve shown Bran using his powers to make correct decisions about some events between him becoming the 3ER and now, to at least give a viable reason for him being a good king. Instead he was just cryptic as shit and confirmed R+L=J, and that\u2019s pretty much it.
They've already said no spinoffs with the current characters. I think arya exploring west would be pretty shitty honestly.
Well no. That was the thing. He originally wouldn't do it, but Varys convinces him:\r\r> What about the lives of your children, my lord? Is that a precious thing to you?\r\rYes, he's leaving his kids. But presumably they would be with the Lannisters, which obviously that's better than them being dead. (For all Ned knows, they could be tortured or killed if he doesn't give a confession)\r\rAlso Cat and Robb are still alive, so they could hopefully get the kids back at some point.
That's why he finally choose to recognize king Joffrey as the true king, before getting his head chopped off anyway. Which makes his end even more tragic, frustrating and schoking. They break him, and he accepts his entire life of honor to be destroyed, for nothing.

Then why was everything green and full of green grass and trees when they showed the scene of the night king's creation. That was \"beyond the wall\" as well. (the wall wasnt technically there yet but the location is north of the soon to be built wall)
I mean basic story telling, if you read, watch or write a story and the first reaction to something that happens is \"wow thats kinda dumb, why wouldn't they just do/say ______\" then its bad writing. \n\nLike with the battle of winterfell, did they make the battle plan by our heros stupid because otherwise it would have seemed like the night king and his army wasn't that strong? if thats the case make the battle plan by our heros water tight, have it on paper so that by all accounts they should win the fight, then just make the night king that much more that even the best plan is nothing compared to him, they spent 7 seasons building up how the nk and his army are the unstoppable death of the world so there was no risk of him seeming \"to strong\" that was the point.
> \"This is a fantasy series with dragons and magic, it doesn't have to make sense!\"   \n\nIn other words, \u201cJust don\u2019t think about it\u201d
That argument is exceptionally stupid for Game of Thrones, because what the series has always excelled at is that even in a world with magic and heroes and prophecies that really come true, *the politics make sense.*
I wish they never chose D&D in the first place, i knew it was inevitable that they'd fuck it up, cause i don't think anyone had ever heard of Dan Weiss before GoT, looking at his IMDB page and it's completely empty other than very very small projects. And Benioff made that Wolverine Origins movie which was horrible. I wish they'd grab someone like Guillermo del Toro, cause i think around the time they cancelled him for The Hobbit, they were starting to make GoT.
Yeah, seriously, you could make the same argument for Marvel movies which basically have what amounts to magic and fantastic creatures.
Someone fetch the westeros stretcher
Nah, the main characters just learned Instant Transmission from Goku.
[deleted]
Wasn't that during Robert's Rebellion?
And when she asked if he could forgive him he didn't even respond
Maybe if you just throw a bunch of symbols together it will mean something?
I swear the writers were purposely fucking with us.
That\u2019s what makes Bran being king so intriguing and why it\u2019ll probably be done much better if ADOS ever comes out. Before with the Night King you could justify Bran\u2019s letting everything happen like Theon\u2019s death because it all culminated with the killing blow that saved Westeros. And now he\u2019s probably let thousands die to become King, which was never even close to being part of his story, and yet all that time spent with the 3ER that we didn\u2019t get to see had to have been about becoming King. I really hope the prequels delve into this stuff more because it seemed like the end of GoT was a victory for the 3ER alone; Bran becoming King had to have been decades in the making, plus some evil 3ER\u2019s would be dope.
Dany is killing innocents because SHE thinks it\u2019s needed for her kind of \u201cgood\u201d; and she was gonna kill millions of others in order to reach her goal. But with Bran letting her kill those millions and setting up the distrust in her in the first place, he assured that she would be killed and couldnt kill more. I guess people see it as \u201che caused Dany to kill a million\u201d but I see it more as a \u201che made sure she couldnt kill MORE than a million\u201d. You could say that he couldve tried to make it so she wouldnt kill a million in the first place, but maybe this was the only way to reduce her kills while also breaking the wheel for the a better distant future.\n\nTotally agree, there really isnt a good, right proper answer, at least until the books!
That stills has the implication that Dany was *right* to torch King's Landing though, if that was the best future from Bran's perspective
The visions are somewhat unclear, but I don't think he can scan the future and act to change it. He only ever acknowledges the fact that events happen because they *have* to. He gives meaning to what happens a posteriori, but he doesn't act to change it in advance (because he can't really know what will happen).
He already manipulated events with Hodor. It's obviously possible.
Or the first responses could've been Bran lying. \n\nIf the 3ER were lying in the end, he'd have no reason to have told the truth in the beginning in the first place. I think it's more plausible that he's been telling the truth the whole time.
The future may not have been changed by Jon\u2019s choice. If Jon had not said anything there is no guarantee Jon\u2019s heritage could not have been found out a different way. Maybe Sam decides he needs to tell someone for revenge? Maybe Tyrion over hears Dany and Jon discussing it? The fact that Jon did spill his secret was a betrayal to Dany which escalated her \u201cmadness\u201d, but it still could have played out the same. The news gets leaked without Jon making the choice,  but Dany feels unloved because the people love Jon. Jon stepped back from Dany the moment he learned of his heritage and I believe that hurt Dany as much as him spilling the news. She chose fear when Jon refused her love. She still lost people close to her which also played into her reaction at KL.
He can't see the future, he only knows that things move in a deterministic way and that whatever happens is what *has* to happen. This has always been his attitude since becoming the 3ER. He doesn't push for things to happen, he just acknowledges that there is only one way they could have happened.
First Bran can't see the future, he can only see visions, out of context scenes that may happen, but the show does a really poor job explaining us what his powers are so I really can't blame you\n\n\nSecondly, do you have a girlfriend? Imagine you have done something bad and your best friend comes over \"TacoMagic it's your choice if you want to tell her what you did\"\n\n\nIs there any possible outcome where you don't tell her and don't spend the night on the couch?
So he's afflicted by visions... of the future... that don't make any sense and he can't do anything with... sounds like a fun ability to have... like a stroke jumping tv channels that he can share with others but it ultimately means nothing because the ink is dry... hurray...\n\nI would not conflate to \"Jon knowing his true identity\" and then telling his immediate family, the thing he literally just said he was going to do.. as \"hiding something from my girlfriend she eventually finds out and I sleep on a couch\" ?\n\n\"Why do you think I came all this way\"\n\n\"It's your choice\" \n\n3EyeRaven playing these fools.
He coulda told arya about the fate of kings landing if he knew, arya would believe him cuz he knew of her list, sansa knows of her faces, and believes bran has \"visions\". Arya could just assassinate danny wearing a face of anyone. Hell danny called her hero of winter fell, she sees arya as no threat to her life anyways even if word gets to her of aryas powers.\n\nIf bran knew and didnt get arya to kill her first.. that to me is weird logic
Really? I\u2019m like the complete opposite. Even as a kid, I was rooting for James Bond to die in Goldeneye just because I liked Sean Bean as 006 so much.
>006\n\n007*\n\nEdit: I apparently need to relearn how to read. Ignore me.
Rob and Jon were boy scouts, too.
Oh I must have missed how they counted every variation of every word.
Personally I don\u2019t expect OP to pay for a program to do something that is not necessary. I don\u2019t know about you
I mean if I'm planning to analyze >100k qualitative data points I would. Although I'm sure there are open source alternatives that can do this.
It deserves as many upvotes as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had nobles.
And it died at the hands of a Frenchman of all things...
    it had a degree of religious tolerance that was missing from England, Spain and France\n\nYou're joking, right? The 30 year's war didn't happen? And the only reason it didn't kick off much sooner was because the HRE was not a state but a loose federation.
You will note how I qualified that in the statement you are replying to and then realize why your response is missing the point.
If Bran is immortal, why was he worried about the NK killing him?
I think he meant to say that Bran can't die of age, so he would live forever if not killed. Personaly, i don't subscribe to that theory, cause the previous three eyed raven only lived that long by merging with a weirwood tree. I doubt that's a possibility for bran as king.
Because the writers wrote that. It doesn\u2019t make sense just because it was written. Why would the white walkers target Wikipedia instead of the A10 Warthogs? Just because Bran was worried, it doesn\u2019t mean it was justified. Out of all the things that don\u2019t make any sense, Bran being worried about dying doesn\u2019t really rank high up the list.
Immortal\u2260Invincible.
That's 4 years old, and it is exactly my point.   \n\nThis season,  she just repeats it like a catch phrase, and it certainly doesn't mean what it did in that clip.  She used it a chant to fire up her army to go and conquer all known lands.\n\n\"Daeny kinda forgot what 'break the wheel' meant.  But the wheel didn't forget about her.\"  if I can be allowed to meme about it.
D&D realized that Dany breaking the wheel was a little too sympathetic because *almost every other character on the show* wants to keep the wheel regardless of their sympathetic perspectives.\n\nIt would literally become Dany versus everyone. Which would be entertaining as all hell, but it would also mean half, if not most, of the audience would find themselves rooting for Dany against the entire Stark family. Which would also be incredibly entertaining but hard to write around.\n\nBasically, the Great Houses are the wheel. How do you write a show where all of the good guys support a horrible system that only one or two of the good guys want to tear down? D&D broke in favor of a fucked-up system that likeable characters mindlessly support instead of a morally grey and sometimes divisive character tearing down the fucked up system that the likeable characters mindlessly support.\n\nWhich is why Tyrion straight-up lies at the end and says that Dany's dream was to make sure the spokes on the wheel stay intact.
Yet people wanted to name the episode \"The Broken Wheel\".  Sorry but to me that's a horrendous name, even with any sort of context, purely for the sake of #***SYMBOLISM***
~#Hashtag~
> That's what I call \"breaking the wheel\", at least in the world of ASOIAF.\n\nno, no no no, no. not at all.\n\nWhat you described is her being a spoke in the wheel, exactly.  And when she dies and has no kid, yet another succession war breaks out between everyone.  The wheel turns once more,  and the people suffer for it.\n\nWhat you describe is exactly the wheel, and Daeny keeps the wheel going full force.\n\nObviously,  breaking the wheel is a democracy/republic and a peaceful transition of power.   No more rights to the throne, no more birthright, no more 'name',  but replaced with people peacefully voting to elect a leader whose job is to serve the realm.  The exact opposite of Daeny and the \"Conquer the World\" message from the latest episode.
We've had medieval kings who specifically took power away from nobles and empowered commoners precisely because the nobles held enough land and wealth collectively to challenge them. Dany's plan wasn't anachronistic, and giving nobles the power to choose their king has more often than not led to more conflict than disempowering them.\n\nThe interesting thing is that a perfect situation for this is a character like Dany who can't follow hereditary succession. She wouldn't want power to be passed down generationally, especially given her experience with corrupt and bloodthirsty Targs and Lannisters.
You could see in his face that he didn\u2019t really mean those things. He was in a tough spot and really wanted her to be good but you can see the anguish in his face while saying those lines to Tyrion. He was having an internal battle of \u201clove vs duty\u201d He wanted her to be his queen and be good so bad that he was trying to convince himself that she was and at the end of the day he knew what had to be done. Sometimes when it\u2019s something that you want so bad but you know is wrong, you need some outside perspective to make the right choice. It\u2019s just like a lot of real relationships when you know you shouldn\u2019t go back with your ex but you do anyways. Jon just needed a friend to put it in perspective because he was blinded by love
That's the problem none of what you said is believable. That scene should feel like that but it just reads like a mix of stupidity and a little of bit of loyalty. Very uncharacteristic, and all to quickly push towards a quick resolution.\n\nJon was made stupid in general and they forced in an unbelievable love/loyalty to fill in any remaining games. He was just a tool to push certain plot points and ultimately made him useless wood as a character.
I agree but 51% did not
I was angry about the ending at first because It didn\u2019t make sense due to how rushed it was. But once I connected the dots through all the recaps and cast interviews I was able to make sense of It all and think It was a good ending. It was just executed absolutely terribly.
Yeah he did say that didn't he. The realm is so screwed
I was running under the assumption that Bran has forfeitted his claim on the North.  \n\nAlso Sansa was Lady of Winterfell when she declared independence, which made her Queen regardless.
It's been going on longer than that.
The lord of light wanted Danny dead?
Nah, he wanted Dany to help. Dany dying would only happen when the Lord of Light \"fucks off\".
would he have needed to be killed like that if Jon's plan hadn't given him the GD dragon in the first place?
Why is such a sensible post buried in this thread? It baffles me that there\u2019s so many people who failed to realize Jon\u2019s entire purpose and why he had to be a half Targ.
Thank you, it\u2019s been hard to find others who agree
Nah I don\u2019t see it that way, he was brought back to bring dany into the fold to defeat the night king and the kill dany before she become too powerful. He purpose was always to kill dany, and to help the defeat the NK not necessarily to kill him himself. When Melisandre goes to dragon stone she said to dany, you and the king in the north both have a role in this war. Danys purpose was served when the NK was defeated. It was only Jon left with one more purpose, kill dany.
Within the show, sure. But of course that raises the question of why the lord of light gives a flying fuck about Dany being alive/dead.
Except the night king got past the wall much faster with the dragon, Dany would probably have time to beat Cersei and take the kingdom pretty fast (even the North had Jon stayed dead). Also, the nk dying the way he died could have happened anywhere, anytime. Bran could have just seeked Arya, waited for a bit for him to show up, and have her ninja her way into killing him.
You think Arya/Sansa/anyone in the North is okay with Dany taking Winterfell? Dany probably kills all the Starks as she burns Winterfell down. The only reason that fight against the dead is close is because of the unity between Dany\u2019s forces and Jon\u2019s forces. Without him the Night King would find a way to win.\n\nAnd, again, even if this wasn\u2019t true. The Red god is a cruel one. It doesn\u2019t *need* to narratively pay off any more than Robb being the king in the north was
Nope. Drogon obviously showed interest in jon in multiple scenes in s7 and 8.
He looked at Jon a few times, therefore Drogon wouldn't kill the person that killed his mother?
It's implied that Mirri Maz Duur infected his wound worse instead of trying to heal it, but yeah. Point still stands.
In the books she tried to heal him but he rubbed sand on his wound(and it's implied she knew he would do that) and it got fucked up further. It's quite confusing
That's the power of the theatre, bitch.
Drogo was killed by the witch though
>I find the Hound's survival less likely than Arya's but people don't go on and on about that.\n\nI agree, Hound should have died. \n\nA \"small knife?\" Look at this [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/h8U43CI.jpg). Looks pretty damn long to me and the Waif buries that thing to the hilt twice and twists it around after the last stab. And you can't be serious about the lower right abdomen not containing any vital organs. That blade was going right in the approximate area where you'd find the right ascending colon and packed coils of ileum and jejunum.
No vital organs as in the stab wound is not going to kill you like if you got stabbed in the heart.  Its the risk of infection, which is likely but its not guaranteed.  I would have preferred them be less dramatic about it yes, but it is not immersive breaking.
See, but I don't think that's satisfying. I get it, life is tough, not everything has a happy ending. But him going back is just not narratively fulfilling. It's like you said, him dying while killing Cersei is palatable, but it's certainly not a happy ending.\n\nUsing your analogy, if I were to watch a story about a drug addict, where he spent the entire film getting rid of it, only to give in in the last 10 minutes and die of overdose... I'd leave completely unsatisfied. I guess that's the point, but it feels cruel just to send a message of \"sometimes things are cruel\".\n\nHe spends 8 seasons struggling with that. At the season 6 finale, he looks both pissed and disappointed at Cersei when he watches her sitting on the throne. Only for him to go back. Feels like an utter waste
Indeed. Which is why I said \"on the context of the show\". The books can have a lot of internal development and monologue. All D&D had to do was not feel obliged to keep the book's ending, and realize that the show is its own thing.\n\nWell, first they actually had to give a fuck to what they were writing.
Tbh D&D probably don't have the chops to make up their own ending to such a complex story to begin with (maybe if it's a generic fantasy story, but it isn't), so they continued to rely on Martin's plot points because at that point there's too much of Martin's touch for them to just abandon and make up their own plot points along the way. Don't think they could coherently bring converging storylines together without his bullet points, even Martin himself is struggling with this that's why his books aren't close to finished.
Interesting cause I totally disagree! I thought the execution was pretyy horrid too, but the bullet points make sense to me.\n\nBran ending up king reminds me of King Leto II in Dune, a ruler who knows the best possible outcomes for humanity. I dunno I just find it more interesting then Dany or Jon ending up on the throne. BUT, they did not do any work to make the ending work whatsoever.
Why even have a throne though? Isn't it clear that one person holding all seven kingdoms is fucked up?\n\n  \n\n\nHow about making all seven kingdoms independent again? I thought they were gonna do something like that when Drogon burned the throne, you know, symbolism and shit, but no... I guess he just wanted to burn it.
Thinking Arya has the most intriguing story and her winning the \u201cfavorite Stark\u201d vote is exactly why we ended up with her supermanning the Night King. It\u2019s fun to point fingers but I will always unequivocally hold you clowns responsible for liking her way too much and leading to the Long Night
Yeah I agree that it\u2019s completely silly to be intrigued by the person who can perfectly imitate anyone and is trained by some kind of crazy assassin school. Yeah, that\u2019s not even close to as intriguing as some of the regular people in GoT. You\u2019re right.
When I next rewatch the show I'm genuinely just going to imagine those storyline getting different endings and still enjoy the build-up.\n\n...at least, that's my hope, maybe I will fail :(
I'll just never re-watch it. There are too many deserving writers out there to waste time being reminded of this trash ending. Thank God D&D are going to Star Wars - a series that's already sucking cock in an alley for every dollar its worth.
The white walker threat was barely a threat lmao, like no one died, they didn't need cersei, they didn't need anything, the only reason the wall even falls is because of Jon's stupid northern expedition.\n\nTry again.
6 named characters died, including two who have been in the show from season 1. They didn't get Cersei, but Jon is responsible for getting Dany to the fight, unifying the north, and getting just about every member of the cast minus Cersei, Qyburn, and Euron there, ultimately. And yes, the wall falls because of him, another way his arc is significant, just as Ned's is significant even though he dies and screws his entire family.\n\nI'm not saying the white walker plotline this season is a masterpiece. But to say Jon's arc doesn't matter because he doesn't stab the night king is absurd.
\"What the hell is wrong with Critics?!  THAT WAS AN AWESOME MOVIE!\" Angry Joe Suicide Squad review.\n\nYeah, no, I wince every time Angry Joe steps outside his comfort zone of videogames,  his TV show and movie reviews lack nuance to say the very least.
Yea, it seems like choosing the lesser of two evils lol. But yea, the North also seems like a dreadful place to live, maybe that influenced a lot of choices as well.
That is what it ends up being, sadly lol That probably did, the south seemed beautiful. However I live in a place like the north irl anyway so it would not be much of a change lol
His men where in a very defensible castle
With no hope of relief against a much larger force.
With a few more episodes her turn would have been believable. The worst thing imo was choosing Bran while not even mentioning the only two legitimate claims.
Or even Gendry now that he was made legitimate.
That was the second worst thing for me. The only set up for that that I can think of is that in Winterfell Tyrion asked him about his story. That is literally it. Add to that he said he doesn't want anymore. However when it comes to being king it is a ln entirely different story. \n\nOn the Aegon side of things, I can see him not being king and I would be okay with it. The injustice comes that not even one person mentioned him. WTF. How can you not at least mention him?!
The rightful heir was Gendry Baratheon, legitimized son of the King of the 7 Kingdoms of Westeros, when they were last unified.\n\nBy any 'modern' Westerosi view, his claim is better than anyone's.\n\n(Edit for clarity)
They didn\u2019t even mention the idea of Jon being king. All the talks Varys and Tyrion have about how Jon would make a great king? For nothing. All of the letters Varys sent to the other lords revealing Jon\u2019s true heritage? Never brought up again.\n\nI mean we all know Jon \u201cdint wahnt it,\u201d and I\u2019m not even saying he should\u2019ve been king, but it should\u2019ve at least been discussed.
I think that was ultimately the biggest problem here. It felt really rushed. I think that they could have even made this ending work if they put more effort and thought into it. Just not a quick gathering out of nowhere that instantly decides who becomes king.
Not to mention that her ending speech to her soldiers was one of the most over-the-top evil speeches I\u2019ve seen in years. It felt like it was 1 step away from being a speech Hitler would\u2019ve given. So much for subtlety.
It might have actually been more subtle if she did the nazi salute at the end. \\s\n\nIn addition to the speach, I know the unsullied have always been a little robotic, but the whole scene had an autocratic feel to it.
Really? She's been really vindictive and brutal from day one....
There is a large difference between being harsh toward your enemies and setting hunting down innocent people as you burn the entire city.\n\nAlso note, there was a time her dragons torched a kid and she locked them away because of it.
I feel the same way. I am hoping that going back to season 7 and then reading some fanfiction that I might be able to make it alright in my head.\n\nI also hope GRRM finally releases the rest of it. Although I don't know how much more tragedy for Daenerys I can take lol
I wouldn't go that far. Season 1-4 were amazing. 5 was pretty good too, 6 was a mix and 7 was pretty bad in hindsight. Season 8 was like someone poured gasoline on a dumpster fire and then launched it into the friggen sun.
I wonder how much longer you'll continue to whine about it on the internet then? A few more weeks?
because it objectively is shit?
Objectively is the new literally I see
Didn't know about the Sansawinsfanclub but the DanandDavefanclub can not exist with a negative opinion on the show and asoiafcirclejerk is a joke subreddit as are all circlejerk subs.  These subs are hardly a fair bar by which to measure anything.  This sub has been the champion of the show when compared to the other two significant asoiaf subreddits on this site and most other asoiaf non reddit forums.  It isn't that the sub is negative, it is that the show tanked.
Dan and Dave fan club? I just threw up in my mouth.
Which honestly says a lot more about you than them. Really, stop shitting on other people who just want to enjoy something.
I don't want to watch star wars where a plot point is one character forgets that another can use the force. Im in 2 minds to not see it, but i really love star wars.
Disney should of realised that GRRMs books were carrying those two. D&D were only good when they adapted existing material from the book, not when they actually had to write (even then they had a blueprimt).\n\nIf anything Disney should of hited GRRM to write a trilogy, my god I would love to see that \ud83d\ude02
I was already kind of done with Star Wars, the Disney movies were disappointments for me and TLJ was the last nail in the coffin.\n\nNow it's like they're going to pry open the coffin, take a dump in it, and seal it back up again.
I'm just waiting for those two to also abandon starwars as they are offered another job somewhere else like they appear to have done with GoT
You guys sound like crazy people do you actually stop to read what you write? WTF am I reading here.
This exactly. Dany's forces were ridiculously overpowered at the end of Season 6. So the writers threw in a bunch of absurd *anti*-deus ex machinas like:\n\n1. Euron's ability to completely surprise and devastate her fleet even though she had Yara who is also a top notch Iron Born seafarer\n\n2. Taking Casterly Rock in a brilliant surprise assault only for Highgarden to fall like it was made of wet newspaper \n\n3. ~~Losing essentially all of her forces at the Battle of Winterfell~~, no that's not it, ~~only half were gone~~, no that's not it either, actually everyone respawned for the attack on KL\n\n4. Losing 2 of her 3 dragons, including Rhaegal to three \"360 No Scope\", \"1 in a million\" shots in 10 seconds after she \"kind of forgot\" about the Iron Fleet even though they talked about it in the same episode minutes before\n\nIt was all ~~a bait and switch~~ *subverting expectations* to make it seem like it was going to be a struggle, all for Dany and Drogon to dunk on Cersei and her armies like Lebron playing some kindergarteners anyway.
I blame the decision to cut Aegon.
Even the deus ex machina fail because if she can cause that mu h destruction with 1 dragons, why bother killing the second especially when in the next episode you bump up the power level by 9000
No one in their right mind would march their entire army to Highgarden and leave KL undefended. When you know someone is trying to attack. \n\nThe whole plot of attaching Harrenhal was dumb as fuck as well.
Yup. And in 7.01 she still had 3 dragons and there were no scorpions.  She could have burned the Red Keep without touching anything else and she would have won.
Literally barely even needs her dragons in 7.01. All that needs to happen is this:  \n\nTyrion - \u201cSo I destroyed the vast majority of Stannis Baratheon\u2019s fleet with wildfire and he still *nearly* took the city. You have way way more forces than Stannis did, so you will go to KL and have the Unsullied and Dothraki break through the Mud Gate and kill the Lannister army. The Unsullied do as you command and the Dothraki think you\u2019re a God so they won\u2019t rape and pillage if you tell them so\u201d. \n\nVarys - \u201cAlso, I know all the Red Keep passage ways. Why don\u2019t you send me with Grey Worm and a few of your other top Unsullied killers and i\u2019ll show them the passages to Cersei\u2019s room.  \n\nDany - \u201cGreat thinking boys. It\u2019s a plan!\u201d  \n\nYara - \u201cWell my Uncle  Euron has a huge fleet, what if they try to attack us?\u201d  \n\nDany - \u201cLol I have dragons\u201d.  \n\nYara - \u201cFair point\u201d.
I mentioned this same thing during 8.05, why the fuck didn\u2019t she just sack Kings Landing BEFORE the battle with the dead? If 1 dragon took it that easily then 3 dragons wouldn\u2019t have even needed a single ground troop to help. AND Cersei didn\u2019t have any scorpions then.
Because she listened to Tyrion's dumbass advice that's why.
in season 7 dany didn't want to burn the city and she thought cersei was gonna help against the dead until 8.02. there's a lot of things in the last four seasons that i thought didn't make sense but i don't think this one is anywhere near the worst offender.\n\nedit: as i've so far gotten three responses to this comment i thought i'd clarify. i agree that it doesn't make sense which is why i didn't say it did but i do think that it still fits with dany's goal of avoiding killing innocents in 7.01. we've seen in the previous seasons and the books that the red keep doesn't house just lannisters so it's not too unfair to assume that there are people who are relatively innocent living there. indimitation might work but she'd still have to demonstrate the power of the dragons to the lannister soldiers somehow. i agree that she could've and should've seiged the city at the start of season 7. i did forget that dany doesn't learn about the army of the dead until later on in the season and i don't think she believed it until 7.06.
At that point, they dont know yet the nightking is a pushover vilain so they think they need Cersei army against him
This. Episode 3 had lots of fanboys defending it but it was a trainwreck and killed 7+ seasons of build up and ruined multiple story arcs. It wasn't even one of the best battle episodes
Was the worst battle episode they had and the worst episode in terms of thematic butchering
I was in denial that it was bad...looking back arya killing NK was fucking lame.
Lol at least the NK got a dragon out of that and raised huge amounts of hype for season 8 (lol)\n\nIn this season every time someone did something incredibly stupid it had 0 payoff.
Yep.  As stupid as the whole thing was I was super excited that the Night King got a dragon.  In fact....the dragon battle between the Night King, Jon and Dany in E3 might be my favorite part of season 8.
[removed]
No, it\u2019s brainless to judge and be insulting someone who likes something different than you.\n\nGrow up...
If you factor in that is the finale and absolutely is a disastrous end to the show then yes.\n\nAs a standalone episode sure I'll give it a generous 3/4
I can see people giving it a 4, but 1? Is it the actual worst thing that you ever watched on television? Seriously?
Why. Arya is a much worse character
Both of them are completely selfish, but at least Arya selfishly wants to murder bad people, whereas Sansa selfishly wants to hoard power at the expense of her siblings and everyone else. Arya doesn't really affect anyone else, whereas Sansa just single-handedly destroyed Bran's kingdom because she's always wanted to be a queen since she was a little kid - not to mention that she may have driven Dany to madness by betraying Jon's trust. Sansa's selfishness has much larger negative effects.
I personally like both the show and the books; and can appreciate them for the aspects that each medium excels at.
if the books ever get finished, I'll probably give it a go again.  should be more enjoyable now that I know it's not high fantasy.
I DEMAND A TRIAL BY COMBAT\n\nBack when the writing was good
I hated that.\n\nGrey Worm: YOU WILL NOT SPEAK!\n\nTyrion: okay cool, but I'm just going to anywau
YOO, Arya and Yara have the same letters in their names
It\u2019s GOT\u2019s \u201cyour mother\u2019s name was Martha????\u201d Moment.
Found the guy who gave it a 10. ^\n\nKidding.
Why did Yara vote for the little brother of the dude that killed her queen she said she was still loyal to that she\u2019s never met? Tyrian\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t that good. Nothing about any of that episode made sense
Because Yara is secretely Jaqen H\\`ghar, duh
um.. she killed the nk?
She knows that how? Also, so? Since when did Yara become a sea bitch?
We didn't have any reaction to *Daenerys* dying. Drogon was the only person who gave a shit on screen.
Little bit from Tyrion and GW but nothing major yeah
> There's already a lot of suspense of disbelief required. So how come it's too difficult to just assume that Yara has been informed about the faith of Theon offscreen?\n\nI'm not saying that I don't believe that Yara was told about Theon's death offscreen, I fully believe that she was. My problem is that we got no acknowledgement of it at all. I felt like that was a really important moment that we missed so that we could watch Tyrian walk around King's Landing for a while longer.
Well, the entire ending felt a bit rushed. There was a lot they glanced over. That's indeed a bit of a problem I agree with. I still don't think that every character death needs to be accompanied by a scene where it shows how it affected their loved ones, especially given that Yara pretty much expected Theon and his comrades to die in their fight against the Night King.
Theon completed his arc, but I don't find the ending that satisfying. It's not problematic as all the other major characters, absolutely, but killing him felt very unnecessary and lazy even.\n\nPersonally, I'd keep him alive as right hand man of Sansa. I also feel like Jon should've died during his fight with the Night King, and then Sansa offers Longclaw to Theon, on an emotionally powerful scene similar to when Daenerys appointed Tyrion as her Hand.\n\nThere. The family that raised him, and that he once betrayed, now fully sees him as a man of honor and loyalty. Redemption arcs don't have to *always* end in death.
Yeah, Theon's death was unnecessary imo, which is why I said it was important only as far as he knew. Really he could've just hung back behind Bran and chilled while the NK took his sweet time and Arya did her thing. \n\nJon dying killing the NK would work, and would save us from three episodes of him serving absolutely no purpose.
Yeah that was as good as it got. Still, Cleganebowl felt incredibly forced. Cleganebowl is one of the best examples of forcing fan service. But yes, ultimately i guess it made sense, but I just didn\u2019t care by that point. It felt incredibly forced. But as far as thematic endings fir characters go it was fine
That was definitely my issue with Arya's arc this season, and a problem with the rushed pacing.  We know that Arya was consumed by revenge for a long time, and we could believe that her character to revert back to season 6 Arya and desperately want to kill Cersei.\n\nBut there is no buildup to how she regresses back, and no real reason why other than for the plot.  She already abandoned her first Cersei assassination mission after realizing she had family in WF, and unlike before, is actually close with Sansa.  She stresses to Jon again about the importance of family, and literally only a few minutes later in the episode decides to go kill Cersei and says she is willing to die to do so.  \n\nAnd the person who talks her out of her revenge mission at the last minute is Sandor, who suddenly decided to go on his own suicide mission to kill his semi-dead brother and is supposed to be the \"vengeful\" one of the two, when Arya was 10x times more vengeful than he ever was.
In season 1, when the Lannisters go after her father and she is practising with the sword master, she runs into the streets when a random boy grabs her and asks about her small sword needle. She reacts by stabbing him in the stomach. He falls and she keeps running. Later she tells the pie boy that she has killed a fat boy like him before and that he should be careful she doesn't do it to him too.  \n  \nEDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEvH5YCATg&feature=youtu.be&t=24
That was a reaction, not intentional.  Manslaughter at best.
I must be honest I forgot about that.
He was going to turn her over to the queen, who Arya probably thought would kill her
1) did you even read my comment?\n\nand if so \n\n2) did you even watch the episode? \n\nif so, refer back to question #1
I'm saying not only were the early seasons better written but they also had way better fights and action in the beginning . All the best fights are in the first 4 seasons. Season 7 skewed towards being just a battle/fighting season and wisely ignored politics/drama cuz they didn't know how to write it anymore. Season 8 skewed back towards drama and politics but it was all nonsense and pointless, it would've been better off being only battles and fighting.
yea thats my point, a lot of people who watch the show arent like us and are super super casual.
I can understand being casual. After all, not everyone can be super committed to things like TV shows, but there has to be a limit, right? \n\nApparently not lmao
Her name is Kelly C.!
Kelly C got mad about losing Miss Sandy
I\u2019ll take people calling her Khaleesi over the ones hat just call her \u201cthe mother of dragons\u201d
\"the dragon lady\"
It's not Khaleesi, it's Kelly C. Kelly Crazy.
so many poor little girls are named after a genocidal maniac
oh shit
Fair enough. I wish you good fortune in the gatekeeping to come.
Night gathers, and now my watch begins.
No, but to dismiss those people as not real fans, or to say \"they probably can't name five people\" is a bit ridiculous. I have a friend who is in love with the show, novels, etc. She knows all the characters, houses, mottos, stories, etc. And she LOVED this last season. Like, she understood the criticism and clearly saw that it was a bit rushed, but she would agree 100% with the people that say this season was \"Amazing\" or \"Satisfying\".
Jon wasn't sent to the Night's Watch to protect the Kingdom from wildlings or the NK.  It was an exile.  That was just a convenient place to exile him instead of Essos like Jorah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey didn't let Tyrion pick the king.  He nominated a king, pled his case, and the others agreed, for varying reasons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBran suffers from the same thing Dr. Strange suffered in Infinity War.  If you know how something plays out, you can't tell everyone or else it changes.  Like I said, D&D had a tough time explaining that, so they jumped a bit and excluded conversations...namely the Bran and Tyrion at Winterfell.  I can accept that they might have discussed this outcome, but you don't have to.  Bran will be the king in GRRM's book as well, so he might explain it, or he might never finish it because he can't either.  As I said, I understand it doesn't perfectly follow a logical progression, but there's enough there that I'm okay, knowing that they probably couldn't explain it neatly.  They didn't need to throw in a \"I saw 14,000,065 timelines and there was onle 1 we won\" line for me to accept it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat powers do you think Bran has gained?  He can see the past and the future, but it's not clear how much he is allowed to change them.  Time travel is tricky, and some amount of fans will always complain about it.  They're targeting Bran because he is the history of man.  They said it in the show.  You can accept that as their motive, or you can believe they have another motive that wasn't mentioned.  We don't need these mythical white walkers completely fleshed out.  We are mostly seeing them from the humans perspective.  They don't know everything about the white walkers, and since they don't know, us viewers don't.  We aren't seeing the show from the POV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think taking another person's face is as easy as killing them and removing it to wear.  There's some magic involved which requires body preperation like in the House of Black and White.  Let's not pretend that it would be a satisfying ending for the story if Arya just donned some faces and assassinated Cersei, Dany, whoever.  Based on the polls, people on this sub don't like Arya having this much influence on the show already, so what would giving her that many big kills do to stop the complaints.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I said, the story wasn't perfect, but you're pointing at all the flaws, big and small, that weren't criticized in seasons past.  Rewatch them and you'll find just as many inconsistencies or stories that just don't make total sense.
> They didn't let Tyrion pick the king. He nominated a king, pled his case, and the others agreed, for varying reasons.\n\nHandwaving away the motivations of the lord of six kingdoms as \"varying reasons\" is exactly what was wrong with the ending. The show is called Game of Thrones, FFS, and the game ended by three/four unfleshed characters aye-ing away their rights to become vassals of a random northerner without a claim to the throne.\n\nNo royal marriages, no scheming, no alliances, no promises, no compromises - just \"yup\".
Except Dr. Strange can see multiple possibilities whereas its not know what Bran sees, but its still morally disgusting. If Bran had acted who is to say the future afterwards would lead to a disasterous future???\n\nNow his king and he conveinently will now only change the future?
Sounds like he just bingewatched for the plot and not the universe. Pretty sad, but understandable.
That\u2019s kind of hilarious because it really does highlight people\u2019s hypocrisy.
There's no more Lannisters though. He's the warden of his own kingdom now.
But everyone is declaring indepence(well, at least they will after the King just let's his sister declares the largest kingdom to be independent) \n\nIt isn't the choice of lannisters or sansa\n\nIts the choice of sansa, Bran, or independence
\"UNPOPULAR OPINION, I liked it\" x100 gold
> This isn't just book readers nitpicking about their favorite theories not coming to fruition.\n\nYet this will be repeated ad nauseum by people who love to strawman criticism.
lol thanks! We kept putting off the show for years, despite all our friends saying we needed to watch it. So we said we'd watch 3 episodes and if we didn't like it, then we'd stop. \n\nWell, we never stopped
There really aren't meaningful discussions, there front page is essentially them hating on freefolk, mocking criticism and overall just circlejerking. \n\nThey reference a poll that interviewed 495 people and state that because 50% of thosd people enjoyed the season \"most\" people enjoyed the season. They honestly think 495 peoplr can speak for 20 million.\n\nThey also hate any criticism unless you overly blazt the season with compliments, every demoted commented is someone just criticising the show. Honestly, they are literally circlejerkimg and continuously have idiotic discussions on how S8 was so good, and if you try to explain that it was rushed - they dont care and downvote you.\n\nThat sub is by far the opposite of meaningful discussions, if you sift through free folk they have better discussions and on this subreddit. Contrary to popular belief those subs don't just have blind hate (the memes sometimes target nuance mistakes) and if you scroll down you can actually see criticism is downvoted for not being logical and manchildrrn comments are down there.
I can't agree with this, many people on /r/asoaifcirclejerk state in the comments that the season was rushed and mention specific things they didn't like about it, and I don't really see these points contested much there.  I also don't really see a lot of statements that the season was \"brilliant\" or \"best ever\".\n\nAs I see it, three things are being contested:\n\n1. the \"consensus\" that S8 was bad, that doesn't exist; the viewership is split on the issue.\n\n2. the notion that anyone who liked S8 must be an idiot (I have gotten replies to this effect myself here).\n\n3. various \"gaps in logic\" arguements being themselves illogical or ignoring previous parts of the show.
> you'd much rather have someone that the public loves be the final winner.\n\nNot necessarily, I just want an interesting character. If a character is interesting some people will want to see them win even if they're not widely popular. But for almost nobody to be interested in Bran is damning and shows what a terrible job D&D have done with the character. I'd have taken someone who was hated like Littlefinger or Ramsay over Bran any day.
Hell I thought Cersei was gonna wind up on the throne back in season 6. That would\u2019ve been much more interesting.
Oh, I concur, it's just the wheel thing itself was never really developed beyond it being said as a grand idea. But it was never really defined, nor how it would be changed.\n\nNot that I think a Grand Council couldn't break out into war/violence, but likely it may be better for the small folk.
i'm very confused
the wire, the sopranos, true detective season 1, breaking bad.\n\nwhy do you assume i hate everything. i just hate this show because i once loved it, and the reason for it being bad (or at least worse than before) are completely OBJECTIVE.
> the wire, the sopranos, true detective season 1, breaking bad.\n\nSorry, nope, those aren't good. You must be mentally challenged to like them. I would know, I don't like them, and therefore I'm mentally superior to you.
Practice makes perfect.
i think the point is more that it\u2019s really tiring being someone here who still enjoys the show, because saying that is like calling a lynch mob to your front door. \n\ncase in point: someone says they like the show and you come back with a snide remark. why are you so insecure that you need an echo chamber to validate your opinion? why can\u2019t people just say they like the show?
Yes, thank you :)
It is. They just wanted to bring some fake tension into the winterfell scenes and failed miserably
How about when he was led out as a prisoner to face judgement and everyone\u2019s like so Tyrion who should be king?
You're nuts.
Anything with a brain could do better than D&D for the writing. He isnt nuts
They deus ex-ed every major plot point in the story. 0 telegraphing, very little sense in the outcome.\n\nHowever they get points for style cinematography and artistry.\n\nYou know all the things that make them great to adopt source material into tv. Only problem is.. source ran out ...
Just like GRRM said, he developed his characters well, too well in fact that they all have their own personalities and he writes based on what their personalities act upon. \n\nThat's all D&D had to do. They written material that goes way outside of the character's personalities.
> I think that's implied pretty heavily with the dragon vision over King's Landing back season 6 or whatever it was.\n\nUnlikely since they didn't come up with many of these twists until after they shot season 6.
> The only person that D+D actually gave a good story arch is Theon. \n\nPartially because his story arc is almost complete in the books. We have yet to see the end, of course, but it doesn't take any more build up to reap the rewards which is the only new bit they tacked on.
So...weird lip service?  \"I don't want to be king, you know it because I said so, even though I appear to have done everything in my power to make myself king.  Also I said I can't be a lord and that I'm not Bran a couple of episodes ago, but now I'm Bran and I can be a king.
Most likely, however it\u2019s the writing that is the problem here. It\u2019s the way they got there not the actual ending that\u2019s the problem.
I mean, I'm sure GRRM also told them to try and least justify/show his deeper moments rather than some dead pan character
I'm not even sure Bran is alive in the show. It called itself the 3ER and kept saying it isn't human and showed no emotion at being reunited with its \"relatives\" so is there anything of Bran left in there? Is it just a flesh puppet warged into by a dying Brynden Rivers with access to Bran's memories? Is the 3ER some psychic parasite that's been jumping from host to host for longer than the Night King has existed and it finally gamed the humans into killing its only real threats *and* put itself in position to control them in one fell swoop?\n\nAnyway, I am sure we got the real endings for Dany, Sansa and Jon. Not so sure the same is true of the other characters and Bran, at the very least, must have a very different path since, as far as we know, there isn't even a Night King in the books.
There has been zero implication that the \"Three Eyed Raven,\" poorly explained concept as it is, was ever some force destined to be king.  The last one spent a century sitting in a cave.  Also \"I'm the Three Eyed Raven, I can't be lord of anything\" doesn't really jive with this.\n\n\nIf they want the entire plot to hinge on Bran's ascendance, maybe take two fucking seconds to make him a character, explain what he is or provide him with some motivation.
Actually, no. I\u2019m calling D&D terrible writers. They completely botched Bran\u2019s story line and character arch, which was devoid of any meaningful content the last two seasons. The problem is not that Bran became king, which I agree is likely GRRM\u2019s intention as well, the problem is how D&D got him to this point.
Yeah, he could be a little more human to Meera if he is capable of joking, thanking and ruling.
Ah another series that ended to poor writing; alad the Dexter series....
An entire team of people didn\u2019t see the discrepancy there. Tbh I feel it was an intentional misdirect and they hoped we\u2019d be too dumb to notice
Just saying that the old gods wanted him to would have sufficed, because they wanted to restore their dominion through Bran. It would have explained some.
LOL \n\nWe kinda forgot about the Old Gods - D&D probably
I think D&D literally *accidently* wrote a seriously sinister line without even realizing it
They subverted themselves.
Same...like he\u2019s a cripple and came all this way from Winterfell...he\u2019s never even been south of Winterfell in his life before.
He's the Three-Eyed Raven he's been fucking everywhere
Yeah all that went nowhere, they just dumped the fantasy aspects
Biggest letdown because that was my personal favourite part. I was dying to find out more about the NK, or the Gods, or the magic that brought back the dragons, or anything magically really. \n\nI feel like we learned nothing new about anything magical between S7-S8 when I thought that would be the most informative part.
They're leaving it for the prequels.
Ugh that would be even worse. Elaborating on WW lore despite the viewers having the knowledge that that whole plot is just belly shanked out of existence.
The *only* logical conclusion based on everything we saw is that the 3ER is an evil mastermind. If that is not what was intended, it speaks volumes about how badly the writing failed this season.
I think that's the only conclusion if you determine that the 3ER was in control of everything, but why do we think that? It seems possible that he was navigating events that he could foresee but couldn't control.
 *never remotely explained or developed upon* \n\nJust like Bran! It all fits together, see?
The fact that he gave Arya the dagger and only ever seemed to be interested in making sure Jon knew his lineage so he could have a falling out with Dany is evidence he was manipulating things. It is extremely unclear why he cared to wait for Jaime in the courtyard though as Jaime was relatively irrelevant.
The dagger is a massive stretch. It\u2019s never acknowledged whatsoever that Bran knows the future. It was pointless for Bran to keep the dagger. As for Jon - Jon\u2019s lineage is never mentioned by Jon or Dany after 8.02. His lineage only caused Varys\u2019 betrayal. His lineage had nothing to do with their falling out, that was all because of Dany committing genocide
No of course there isn't, but that's why I loved the finale so much; everything is open for interpretation.\n\nI do think that line was all they needed to throw in there to get the gears turning in peoples heads. They did what they could with 6 episodes.
Lol fair enough I guess.
I think Bran as depicted in this final episode is nothing more than an object in Tyrion's arc. He is elected because of some weird speech by Tyrion and is then shown to be completely uninterested in doing anything as King as Tyrion leads the small council meeting. Tyrion is essentially king at the end and is finally trying to do a good job and care about everyone or w/e. Bran became king because he is an emotionless husk who is useless and won't do anything selfish. However, I prefer an evil 3ER interpretation.
That\u2019s a fair argument. Still doesn\u2019t explain why anyone outside of Sansa and arguably Tyrion (who wasn\u2019t supposed to have power in that scene) want Bran as king.  \n\nSweet Robin would\u2019ve made about as much sense for king
His first action as the King: Bran says \"perhaps I can find him\" Find him for what? Maybe control him? Im 100% sure he is the true villain. And any writer worth anything would see that that's what you just set up :P
He does not imply that he was manipulating the events, only that he is a part of them. He has always and repeatedly said that everyone *has* to play their part, not that the part can be changed or manipulated. He has a purely deterministic view of the world.\n\nWhat he meant was \"I find myself here in front of you at this particular moment and not somewhere else because this is what has to happen\".  There is no free will, just a fulfilment of something that is predetermined.\n\nThis is the way Bran has behaved and spoken since he became the 3ER, only acknowledging that events have to happen the way they are set up to happen, and not differently.
And the predetermined worldview you describe only happens through characters and plotlines acting in utterly unrealistic and absurd ways
He has Wisdom.
Or you'd think he could have warged into drogon to stop dany
that's too petty a title for the 3ER. Nothing below King for him.
He obviously isn't, seeing as Jon is. However, there's no way to tell from the data in this poll what the distribution of people's second-favorites looks like (this being the distribution of first-favorites). Sure, Bran probably isn't the most common second-favorite, but given the questiom asked in this poll we can't know for sure.
I think it\u2019s safe to presume you picked the least important part of my comment.
Wait. No. Jon meant say \"I don't want it\"
Eyyy dun waahhnnt eet
DO Daenerys know da way?
Seriously, as if that was her first child.
As if she hadn\u2019t already pushed one of her children to suicide.
Characters forgetting things is the central theme of season 8.
Exactly; you'd think he'd realize by now that she didn't care for anyone ezcept for power.
Cersei only loves herself.
I mean...that's blatantly wrong. She clearly loves her children. She's just a psychopath about it.
They aren't its just a border town now.
Pretty sure there is no nights watch...the entire castle black is full of wildlings you don't see any crows. \n\nIt was just the players in the 7 kingdoms pulling a fast one on an outsider (Greyworm)
The realms of men.
There was no night watch at the castle. He ran off with the free folk. Hopefully he will use his leverage withbthe monarchs of the north and south to broker good trade deals for the wildlings .
Shadow cats, ice spiders, dire wolves. Pretty much stuff that was never mentioned in the show
The NK will rise again, and so will the white walkers.
I don't think the children would make the same mistake twice.
Winter is coming.\n\nThe most *chilling* of house words because it\u2019s always true, and now has a very permanent double meaning that they didn\u2019t realize was a reality. \n\nUntil the next generation \u201coh they\u2019re all dead you\u2019re crazy/no such thing. And the cycle repeats, but the north remembers
Snarks obviously.

No it was beyond the wall. You see the same arrowheadshaped mountain in the background as we saw in season 7 ep 6 \"beyond the wall\"
No it doesnt... it doesnt imply that she was right, just that she couldnt be stopped properly until after it (maybe killing her beforehand wouldve brought her armies\u2019 wrath to a larger portion of westeros and thus killing way more people)
I think he's trying to say her killing the city was the only way to get her followers to see the truth about her. (Mainly Jon and Tyrion). And once they saw the truth then they took action. I think it's telling that the Dragon and the Unsullied didn't kill Jon outright. I think that kind of shows that even they knew deep down that Dany crossed a line. That she had to cross the line so people could see the truth. Otherwise she would have stayed queen and the endless wars would have continued with deaths piling up but in small enough piles that you never realized the body count was so high until it's too late.
But why tho, I can see Bran being the bad guy but that would be really boring, you can literally find an extra, have him kill a bee and he would have more background as a villain than Bran\n\n\nI don't know, it sounds like D&D had no idea what to do with Bran so they just let him be a bystander that acts like a god and let the fans write a good theory\n\n\n[GRRM's thoughts about characters that turn out like Bran]( https://grrm.livejournal.com/82239.html)\n\n\nIMO this will be GRRM ending too but it will actually make a lot more sense, D&D just kinda took the idea and didn't even try to explain why
I think, if this happens in the books, it'll have quite a bit of creepier undertones. Bran's tutelage in the books is practically eldritch in its atmosphere, and Bran himself has been doing increasingly questionable, agency-ignoring things.
I don't think D&D knew why, so we don't know why. \n\nHere's hoping GRRM rocks it!
Sean Bean was 006 was he not? He didn't play James Bond.
Oh! My reading comprehension must have been non-existent when I posted that. I thought that they were saying they wanted Bean to be the next 007. \n\nRe-reading it now, I just definitely misread.
I would too, if I\u2019m getting paid.
Bran wasn't just worried. We saw the NK kill the other TER, and we saw him about to kill Bran. It's pretty obvious he isn't immortal.
Did the look on Bran\u2019s dopey ass face look worried?\n\nI agree with you that he isn\u2019t immortal, but I really don\u2019t think it matters to the story at all. After cameras started filming this season the writers made it clear that they don\u2019t give a fuck what happens after the cameras stopped.
OK, I'll concede yes, the TER is immortal in the sense that he can pass his consciousness on to another living person. This is what the old TER did as soon as he knew the NK would be coming for Bran. Bran never went through a similar process of passing on his knowledge to another person, so there was a very real chance he was going to die, and not be able to pass on his consciousness, and therefore not be immortal.
>think It was a good ending. It was just executed absolutely terribly.\n\nSo not a good ending.
For example danys arc is unreal did she go insane or did she make a conscious decision to rule with fear and tyranny. The show made it seem like a little of both. Makes no sense it\u2019s one or the other. Martin will clear that up for us.
Because a lot doesn\u2019t make sense.. but if you\u2019re a book reader you should have enough information to understand the ending. Martin will answer all our questions when he finishes his books. The show ending is his ending
Because she would have plunged the world into darkness with her tyranny. Duh
\ud83e\udd14
They weren't cool with the Boltons either, but wouldn't join the fight against them. Also the Boltons would be in power. \n\nThe NK did find a way to win anyway, and he died cause Arya is sneaky. \n\nRobb being king in the north did pay off. The red wedding is the payoff of that plot line. It doesn't need to be positive payoff to be payoff.
Strawman. You said dragons bond with one rider. Drogon clearly bonded with jon multiple times. They also bonded with tyrion in the crypts though you could argue that was just because they were chained up and wanted to be free
They didn't bond with Jon, they just looked at him. Dragons have one rider and they have killed other Targaryen such as during the civil war.\n\nDo you know what a strawman is?
No, in the books it's clear she was never trying to heal him. She is very strict about not removing the salve because it's actually a poison and abrasive enough that he would want to remove it. She ensures his death by convincing Dany it's going to heal him, then takes her son and any future children from her.
Yes it may not kill you near-instantaneously like the heart but if the bowels are lacerated death is still highly likely. They are highly vascular organs and the internal bleeding would have been massive and unstoppable without doing surgery. And it's not just infection risk as with any other wound. Bowel perforations leak bacteria laden fecal matter into the abdominal cavity\u2014it's a whole other level of fulminant infection.
It's complex, but it's significantly less complex than the books. Considering that, in an ideal world, they'd have to redo seasons 7 and 8, by the end of seasons 6, major characters that need resolution and/or converging are:\n\nDaenerys/Tyrion/Varys, Jon/Sansa, Littlefinger, Arya, Bran, Yara/Theon, Jaime, Euron and Cersei\n\nThe trickiest one is Littlefinger, and Arya considering what they did to her in season 6. It's perfectly doable with any amount of effort, and that's the thing: there was no effort. People have been throwing around the idea that D&D suck balls, but there's plenty of fantastic show-only scenes written by them.\n\nThey *can* write, they just were too lazy and uninterested these two last seasons. Which is probably even worse.\n\nAnd it might not be generic fantasy, but it's still a fantasy story. The ending didn't need to be \"holy shit, that was insane!\", it just needed to be satisfying I find. \"Bran drove Aerys mad by whispering 'Burn them all' into his ear\" would've been \"crazy\" enough I find, and then just finish your character's arcs in a way that makes sense.
I honestly thought Arya was great until she reached the faceless men, at which point her entire arc just becomes nonsense.\n\nIt's like the story bends itself backwards trying to make her cool, to the point where she just becomes a Mary Sue to me. Like the faceless men become incredibly inconsistent and nonsensical to justify her breaking away, and then her character basically just becomes Smug. Like what was the point of taking faces if she uses it once to kill an entire family (who knows if any of them are innocent) and never again.\n\nBeforehand she made sense and was a fun character who played off well with other characters, the show added Tywin and Arya stuff is a highlight, afterwards she's a complete mess and really being a character to me, which is a consistent issue in later series (looking at you robot Bran).
Blah blah blah yeah, if you were genuinely enthralled by Arya\u2019s beef with the Waif come in immediately for some brain testing, I feel like we could make huge breakthroughs in entertainment if we got a look inside your mind
Yeah, no, that's not how writing works. If you spend 6 seasons building up some supernatural existential threat, the catalyst for that threat becoming *an actual threat* can't be \"the main characters decide to not do nothing\". Had Jon *literally just fucking stayed dead*, then the Long Night either never happens or it happens in a way that uh...makes sense. That doesn't make his arc significant, it makes it pointless. No one has to unite, because the NK is a joke who can get murdered by some rando faceless man, and since the horn of winter doesn't exist in the show, he has no way past the wall without Jon going up there to begin with. If Jon does nothing or just stays dead, the arc doesn't happen. That's not to say you cant have the plot be about the protagonists cleaning up a mess they caused, and an antagonist they made/empowered/released, but that's not what happened. The WWs have been advertised as the real threat since the first episode of the first season. But they weren't. They were a nonfactor; the world didn't need to unite to beat them, as we see by Cersei sitting the entire thing out and only \"half\" of Dany's forces dying despite that, and that's *with the dragon the Walkers had that they wouldn't have had otherwise*.\n\nAlso thinking named characters dying means anything lmao. Hey guys, Lommy and mandon moore died! Oh no! They're named characters so that matters, right?\n\nThe Battle of Winterfell was narratively pointless, Dany is shown being able to demolish KL with *only* Drogon, the NK was never a real threat, no one important dies, I could go on forever.\n\nYou're the one reducing it to \"ur mad Jon didn't stab him\"\n\nNo, I'm mad he didn't destroy fucking anything despite being hyped up the entire show. Ramsay was more formidable than that chump lmao.
And if Ned hadn't told Cersei he knew about the incest, then he wouldn't have died and none of books 2-3 would have happened. And if Robb hadn't married Jeyne Poole/Talisa or sent Theon to the Iron Islands, the Red Wedding wouldn't have happened. Protagonists' mistakes causing their problems is a common trope in this story and in \"writing\" (lol at \"that's not how writing works,\" as if there's one guide to writing fiction that you just need to follow). \n\nNow, I agree that there are problems with the Beyond the Wall plotline. If the only way the night king gets beyond the wall is a dragon, and the only way he gets a dragon is by sheer dumb luck, that makes him a less interesting villain. I also wish more of the supernatural aspects and their fallout had been addressed before or after the battle.  I think The Long Night would have been more powerful of more characters died, and I wish many characters did more significant things in the episode itself, Jon included, to create more of a climactic feel. But let's not exaggerate. More characters do die in this episode than any other battle of the series, and among them are very significant characters like Jorah and Theon, not Lommie. The fallout from the battle affects the plot, driving Dany's rage and failed messiah complex, leading to the Bells. Jon is still the one who united half of Westeros and who gets credit (along with Arya) for winning the battle, causing Dany to feel more isolated and unloved in Westeros, leading \nto all that happens in the second half of the season. \n\nMeanwhile, claiming character arcs are pointless because a character doesn't destroy anything (in a glorious way, presumably? Because Jon does kill Dany) shows at least a massive oversimplification of what the term \"character arc\" means.
Yeah I straight up would have been more satisfied with Gendry. He was always somewhere on the list of possible contenders, while Bran was annoyingly out of nowhere.
tbh if they had a few more seems of him being explicitly heroic that could have been a VERY good twist.
I actually forgot about that. He sort of disappeared after that whole thing. These people should have been at least brought up.
He's even part Targaryen!
D&D kinda forgot about what they wrote in Episode 5
I feel like this has always been her story arc though. She always claims to be good and tries to do the right thing, but the second someone stands between her and her ambition she lashes out. Maybe it's me, but I feel like this is one thing that's always been in the series. The question if she's going to be as crazy as her ancestors or if she will rise above it.\n\nI mean, do you remember when she crucified the Masters? That was brutal and not exactly the only option available to her. She's always had that in her and this was a constant pattern within the series with Tyrion trying to temper her. I agree that this was a step further, but it didn't feel entirely out of character to me.
I apologize if it seems like I was trying to argue that it would not happen, I am trying to argue it was too fast. \n\nFor me, after hearing the bells, she should have taken off and destroyed the castle anyways. Which would be in character because of the brutality toward her enemies. Then once she has taken over, there is some unrest because of her destruction of the keep and the dothraki doing dothraki things. To stop the unrest she executes some civilians. Then more unrest. More executions. Until finally jon has to kill her. \n\nSomething that would really allow us to see that ultimate power push her over the edge. Instead of getting emotional on a dragon one day, torching a city and becoming hitler.\n\nIdk, that is just my opinion.
Objective means in my opinion right?
People are allowed to be fans of Hitler as well. It doesn't make what he did right.
>People are allowed to be fans of Hitler as well. \n\nI always knew there was something wrong about this place.  This sub has gone bonkers.
Didn't realise writing Game of Thrones was equivalent to genocide
Lady, I think you forgot your hormone pills.
To be fair they\u2019ll probably adapt one of the legend stories like knights of the old republic or something
Thats fucking lame, holy shit thats lame. People are expecting new stories not old rehashed ones.
Lmao I know right
That dialogue is too intelligent for current Tyrion.
That's also when they still had support of high garden and dorne as well \ud83e\udd14 good thinking on tyrion's part to save bloodshed...
Quick fix, Euron is Yara's (and Theon's) uncle.
And he got rewarded in the end.
I find this one of the most upsetting things. Danys downfall was tyrion stulid abd her blindly trusting him. You accept a few mistakes such as taking casterly rock wheb the army took highgarden however to have it done consistebtly by a character we know to be one of the most intelligent characters in the kingdom just to fit thw plot you lose the suspension of disbelief
she didn't have to.  just burn the keep.  or just sit there with the dragons intimidating as fuck, and watch everyone throw down their weapons and offer her cersei's head.
i don't think the keep housed just lannisters and she hadn't really demonstrated how powerful dragons are at that point. i do agree that it doesn't make a ton of sense and did say as much in my first comment but i just think the decision is kinda in line with dany's goals at the time.
Umm Dany doesn\u2019t even know about the NK till 7.06. In 7.01 there was literally zero reason she doesn\u2019t just show up at KL with her fucking laughably enormous army and three nuclear weapons.
So there are more than 2 situations here. She could still have taken King\u2019s Landing without burning all the women and children. After seeing the power that 1 dragon has then 3 dragons would be more than enough to win a war with the Lannister\u2019s. Just by intimidation if anything. Unless you think the only way to win a war is by killing everyone associated with the other side (total war) then she could have done that too. And she didn\u2019t think Cersei was going to help with the dead until the last episode of season 7. It had nothing to do with her motivations in the beginning of season 7
i mean i agree that it doesn't make sense considering how fucking strong drogon was in 8.05 but like i said, i don't think it's anywhere near the worst offender and not burning down the city or even the red keep is kinda in line with her motivations of taking the city without a loss of innocnet life as i'm pretty sure that even the red keep doesn't house just lannisters. honestly though i think a lot of people who write sci-fi or fantasy fuck up when they introduce some super powerful weapon that only one side has and then try to somehow portray it as a somewhat even fight.
The nightking having a dragon was fine. The dragon being his ticket to pass the wall was disapointing as hell ( but also predictible the moment he got the dragon)
[removed]
Like I said, grow up
I put 2 because the actors and realisation were good. But the writing is probably the shitest i ever saw.\nI spent half this last episode laughing in disbelief honeslty
Like I said if you factor in the rest of the show   and all the other impacts of this episode yeah I could believe someone giving it a 1.  Just like I can see someone who just wants to watch a big spectacle giving it a 10
I can honestly say there was no other episode of tv from other shows that I've seen that made me more disappointed or angry.  and most of this season has writing as bad as I've ever seen anywhere.
Then you don\u2019t watch enough TV....
They get more high fantasy as they go along. GRRM wanted to sorta do the opposite of Tolkien;instead of startibg with lots of magic and show it slowly fade away, he started low magic and slowly introduces more and more of it into the world.
magic is still negligible and mostly irrelevant, but most high fantasy centers around magic
The high fantasy elements really start up after book one with the birthing of dragons. Especially for characters in Essos. Still not as high fantasy as something like wheel of time.
sure. she's just the leader of a nation, she wouldn't know anything about something major like that.
Well Dany literally forgot a major part of her enemy's forces so nothing is out of the ordinary if Yara wasn't told Ayra killed the NK
Oh, but the NK wouldn't die in Winterfell if I had any say on it. I'd make them win the Battle of Winterfell, then the living keep retreating south all the way to King's Landing, where they make their last stand.
I mean they didn\u2019t even really have fight scenes early on. but now we have entire episodes dedicated to it. Like the battle where jamie got kidnapped.... they legit didn\u2019t even show it. they just showed what happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAPLiWPgLUQ\n\nThese are all better than anything we got in Season 8. Except for like dragon CGI stuff
Ugh even worse
The answer to your last line is they're tired of war.  If you want me to break it down how I interpreted it, I can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdmure- Riverlands.  He was a prisoner for years, was shut down by his niece when he was trying to nominate himself.  He lost the castle his uncle took, accepted his nephew's nomination.  Not really that objectionable for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSam- Reach.  He is best friends with Bran's brother.  He knows a bit about Bran's powers.  Thinks Bran might rule well with great knowledge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyrion- Westerlands.  Nominated Bran, obviously has great respect for him.  Thinks he will serve the realm well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGendry- Stormlands.  Newly appointed lord, presumably knows very little.  He loves the king's sister, has respect for his brother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRobin- Vale.  Yohn Royce gave him the look to agree.  Bran's cousin presumably on decent terms.  I'm unsure of how much Royce has filled him in, but he probably thinks Bran will be a fair ruler, as the Vale and North have been close since S6.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrince of Dorne.  I don't know about this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYara- Iron Islands.  She probably does not want Bran to be king.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDavos.  Holds the Stark family in high regard.  He's just looking for a fair and just ruler, no reason to think he doesn't think Bran will be that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome people might have enjoyed it, or wanted it, but we didn't need two more seasons of Gendry learning how to be a high lord.  We don't need to see the mess of a political situation that is Dorne, considering everyone very vocally hated it in S5.  With the rest, most are related to Bran, or hold his brother in high regard.  They have no reason to fight over this and potentially continue the war.  It's not a random northerner.  He is the last living son of Eddard Stark, warden of the north.  Prior to his death, Varys had been sending ravens all over.  We can assume he had relayed the events at Winterfell.  People know Bran's story.
i mean i hate to break it to you but you're not being clever at all, you're not actually arguing against anything i've said you're just screeching over my choice of words. shame you can't counter my point. i was hoping you'd ask how GoT is objectively bad but you still haven't.
Twice you accused people who liked this season as being borderline mentally challenged. You aren't arguing with any shred of integrity, so you certainly don't derserve my time or anything that isn't me throwing your insulting nonargument right back in your face.
OK...physically...
Well for one the 3ER is a spiritual entity that passes from host to host and is thousands of years old. It can also see the future, which is shown by the visions Bran has. It also basically took actions such as revealing jons heritage for no reason other than to cause kings landing to be massacred and himself to become king. There was no other result from that action. \n\nSo he's basically worse than Dany because he doesnt care about 1 million people being slaughtered while being completely sane, has total surveillance over everyone, and will be king for at least 1000 years in brans body, potentially forever if he swaps host and makes the new host king.
Yeah, I can see that. I think you got it right with the \"writing failed\" comment, though. I don't think we were supposed to take this grim analysis away from the show. I think painting it this way is just indicative of how much season 8 collapsed. And I think it's stuff like this that is making it difficult for George to finish the books himself.
Jon stops fucking Dany because of his lineage, that is the true problem it causes. The show unintentionally makes Dany not getting fucked by Jon anymore one of the biggest motivating factors of her madness. \n\nBut yea also nothing about Bran is acknowledged. He's the greatest war asset of all time and he does nothing to help. The fact that he gave the weapon that killed the Night King to the person that killed the Night King is certainly relevant.
I think it was more about her desperate loneliness than Jon himself. But I agree, they set up the scene as the specific moment that Dany\u2019s madness is locked into place. And the trigger is Jon\u2019s rejection of her advances. \n\nIt would have been cool if Dany\u2019s entire character arc wasn\u2019t derailed in a ten-seconds telenovela scene.
Bran sees the future in visions: he sees a dragon over kings landing; eventually that does happen and it turns out to be Drogon burning Kings Landing.
I understand why so many people are complaining, but it's typically the same reason across the board: \"it was rushed and things weren't explained.\" Sure, there were some dumb moments, but that's the main complaint.\n\nWith the few episodes they had, I think they did a great job and I'm fine with having to come up with some of my own ideas to fill in the blanks until the books come out.\n\nI like being left wondering a bit mixed with the relatively happy ending that we got.
[deleted]
Tyrion convincing anyone that Bran is the best King didn't make any sense at all. Elective Monarchy? Sure makes sense after the last two Heirs eliminated themself as candidates just now.  But why the youngest Stark who doesn't even speak?\n\nBtw where has Dorne been all the time and why are they now suddenly interested in who becomes King again? And why do they agree with Bran who they probably didn't even know existed.
Bran is totes a villain and people are just unable to accept it.
This has nothing to do with him being or not being able to see the future and manipulate events to change it.
Umm no you\u2019re arguing Bran merely lets things play out in a predetermined way. My argument is two-fold 1) This is barely alluded to whatsoever outside of two throw away lines. 2) If your argument is correct it is only correct because other characters have been made to act in outlandish and ridiculous ways
I thought the entire point of Hodor is their world isn't predetermined and could be changed and manipulated. There is something sinister about the way he asked Sam to tell truth and told that is the right time and also all the staring he had on Tyrion throughout the season.
I don't think the children can make the same mistake again.
Well, now that the knowledge of how WhiteWalkers are created is out there, this would be the set-up for a sequel series where some evil guy births a new Night King.\n\nOfcourse, I think Bran is the only one who knows so he'd have to have told Tyrion or somebody.
KL had mountains around it and it changed in the last seasons, you can't really use that as an evidence, they apparently have the technology to move around mountains in westeros.
It was literally the exact same mountain. There would simply not be a single reason to use the exact same mountain for different purposes. https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-579d1ac34cfc1b12153f8afa8f100fc6
It\u2019s all good, I can see how you read it that way
Yeah, but if it leaves people so confused its not a good ending. The execution also matters, not just the plot.
> I was able to make sense of It all and think It was a good ending\n\n.\n\n> Because a lot doesn\u2019t make sense..\n\nchoose one
Directly after watching It, I was very confused but then after thinking about It and taking into consideration the information from the books, I was able to connect the dots of how martin would finish the books with the ending from\nthe show. \n\nFor anyone who didn\u2019t read any of the books, they would never understand wtf happened this past season. Only with supporting info from the books can you kinda understand these characters motives and guess some things.
Lmao whatever. It was clearly meant as a bonding moment. Drogon was interested in jon and let him pet him. Then they showed dany intrigued at deogon doing that cause he never had before. You can tell it helped her her start loving jon the way she looked at him then. Cause she knew he was special for drogon to like him. Did you not even watch the scene lol.\n\nThen rhaegal bonded with jon by letting him ride him and pet him. How is a dragon letting you ride him not bonding lmao.\n\nSo there are at least three instances of dragons bonding with more than one person.\n\nYes i know what a strawman is. Its what you just did. i am solely talking about your comment regarding dragons bonding with only one rider which has been shown to be objectively false.\n\nI am well aware dragons have killed targaryens and of the civil war.
>then he wouldn't have died and none of books 2-3 would have happened\n\nUh, you sure about that buddy? I'm pretty sure Robert still dies, Joffrey still ascends, and Stannis still finds out he's the rightful heir. So uh...yeah no, the plot still happens. It definitely happens differently, but it still happens.\n\nThe plot doesn't happen if Jon just doesn't go north of the wall. We don't have to extrapolate with your example; we *know* Robert's death and Stannis taking up arms are independent of Ned's decision to tell Cersei he knows about the incest. But we *do* have to invent a way for the army of the dead to get beyond the wall, because the show never gives us one. They do it with Viserion. And Viserion remains their best weapon, since without him, only the NK himself and the...wind, are stopping all 3 dragons from just toasting everything even *if* they magically get over the wall and down to winterfell.\n\nSo uh, no. Also lol at the deaths. As for the fallout, you're right...sorta...but the fallout has nothing to do with a *battle*. As we see in episode 5, all of Dany;s setbacks were meaningless. Drogon can solo King's Landing. The end. None of the past 2 seasons affects her conquest in a meaningful way, and thus the WWs are reduced to a plot device to kill Jorah, while the rest of her woes with Cersei/Euron only happen to get Missandei killed, as together it robs her of advisors. *That's fucking it*. She can take KL with one dragon, which is what she should have done a season ago. Also, there's no justification for ep5 anyway, her turn towards genocidal Hitler comes out of nowhere, advisors or no, so if you're actually daft enough to try and defend that hilariously bad writing then you're a lost cause. As I've said a few other places, the fact that Anakin's turn to the dark side (which goes from conflicted but still on the side of the law to child murder in ~15m of screen time) is being cited as a heel turn executed *better* than Daenerys says everything about how much of an utter failure her transition to a morally black bad guy is.
> Which would be in character because of the brutality toward her enemies.\n\nHer enemies were the people of KL themselves, as she directly stated in dialogue that very episode. She knew from the moment word got out about Jon, that her fight to win the throne was no longer exclusively against Cersei. Removing Cersei was now only one obstacle. She knew she needed the rest of the country, the smallfolk and lords that would renounce support for her and stand behind Jon, to fear her completely. If she had only taken out military targets, it wouldn't send the same message. If the people hear of half a million burning alive in KL, they would be more inclined to hesitate in supporting a force against her, because she won't just destroy the army you send, she will burn you and your family down in your home.\n\n\nShe knew the battle needed to not just be won, but be won *a certain way*. She *needed* to take out Cersei *with maximum collateral damage* to send that message. She never thought a surrender would be sounded, so she would have a marketable excuse for why the battle \"had to continue\" until her enemy was defeated, and that she was willing to kill half a million to complete her objective, again, sending the message that noncombatants that don't support her aren't safe.\n\n\nWhen the bells were rung, she knew she would lose the throne then and there if the battle ended right away. Not a loss to Cersei, but a loss to the people of the 7 Kingdoms, who would rise against her and her inferior claim. She had to either give up right then and there on achieving the throne, or kill the people anyway to serve her ambition. The choice to serve her ambition to the detriment of others is one she has made numerous times in the past.
Her enemies were Cersei, Euron, The Mountain, The Golden Company, possibly Sansa, other Westeros lords and ladies that were against her. The people of Kings Landing were not.
What they did to the last season was pretty comparable, yeah.
3/10 troll, try harder
We\u2019ll see, the new trilogy was supposed to be new stories and look how that went lol
Exactly. The new trilogy began with a rehash of the fourth movie and the second movie in the trilogy was illogical and simply poor.
A lot of movie-goers won't be familiar with the books/video games and it would be the first time we would get to see it in a cinematic format.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are tons of films and television shows adapted from existing works including, of course, GoT so an adaptation isn't necessarily a bad thing.
If there is one thing D&D can do its adapt.

Yea, but I mean like ostensibly The Long Night was a battle episode, but there wasn't really any more fighting that that Syrio fight in Season 1, it's almost entirely just piles of wights on top of people who aren't dying for some reason. The Long Night was a battle for the fate of the world and its less engaging and less action than Tyrion's trial by combat in the Vale. I guess its just my opinion but ultimately my point is more fights/battles doesn't need to mean less drama/politics/intrigue/good writing
ok but you've still replied 3 times with nothing. why?
I explained why. You can't argue with integrity.
I dont know what GRRM has planned ofc, but honestly the 3ER being evil in the books wouldn't surprise me too much. It's actually a fairly popular book theory. After all, the 3ER is tied to the CotF, who were the original natives of Westeros that were invaded by humans and driven to near extinction. If the 3ER ends up taking over mankind it's like the ultimate revenge for them.
Just seems like not a very satisfying ending, even as a subversion of the genre like GRRM likes to do. All this just for an evil all-knowing dictator to take over? \"Mwahahaha - The End\" would not be a great ending to all of this.
Won't refer to season 8 writing other than telenovela from now on.
You're completely correct, and it sucks, but it is what it is and there's no option but to hate it because it's rushed, or just love it for what it is and what they did with it.
I choose the third option, be annoyed because it could have been so much better. A shitty ending to a great series.
It is in fact very transparent in the way Bran acts. He always stresses how things have to happen.
Except he really doesn\u2019t though. He literally never stresses any of that outside of \u201cyou were where you supposed to be\u201d and \u201cwhy do you think i came all this way\u201d. - Two lines, that\u2019s it...
Did he really change anything with Hodor though? He was the exact same throughout his entire life that Bran and most anyone else knew. He was always going to be affected by Bran meddling in the past, it just hadn't yet happened in the present. It's all predetermined.
I know, but GOT showed us that reasons do not matter. KL changed his position in the world, they used the same gate entry for KL and another city, it's just random.\n\nMaybe you're right, maybe the writers are, we just can't know that.
Well this one is actually obvious that it is true. The children of the forest were forced to flee to the north because of the first men moving in from the south. They made the NK for a last ditch effort to win the war.
God knows what Disney are doing with Star Wars tbh, the only think I\u2019m looking forward to is the madalorian show, everything else is just extra
Disney are doing the exact same thing D&D did with season 8: subverting expectations....\n\nPerhaps thats why they hired D&D
If you prefer Stan that works too
yeah I agree with you there but all I was saying is they steered in the direction of battles and flash visuals rather than the actual \u201cstory\u201d. \n\nI think we can both agree the 8th season is trash and it all went downhill after GRRM stopped getting involved/they strayed away from the books
and you've based that on one comment, despite me trying to open up the conversation after that? imagine assuming someone has no argument and then using that as your argument for not expressing your own argument. what an exercise in futility.
> and you've based that on one comment\n\nNo, you did it twice.\n\n> despite me trying to open up the conversation after that?\n\nAgain, why would I engage with you when you just call people mentally challenged for having a different opinion? I gave you an out to explain you exaggerated, but you doubled down. So, explained to me why I would engage in an argument with you about the show if you legitimately believe I'm mentally challenged for liking it. It's straight Ad hominem off the bat, bro. You cannot argue with integrity, so it's a waste of my time. You cannot be reasoned with.\n\n>  imagine assuming someone has no argument \n\nYou presented no argument. You just called people who liked this season borderline mentally challenged. Excuse me if I didn't assume you actually had one when I gave you an out and you, instead of presenting your argument, just doubled down on your insulting accusation.
The ending is the planned ending GRRM had...are you sure you don't mean the events leading up to it?
The ending is shaped by the events leading up to it. You cannot examine the ending without looking at how it came to pass.
Take any of Bran's dialogues in the previous episodes. He is always speaking of events as if they happen because they have to. What does he say to Theon? \"Everything you did brought you where you are now, where you belong.\"\n\nWhen he meets Jamie, he only acknowledges that Jamie pushing him led to him becoming the 3ER, again implying that everything had to happen the way it did. He also asks how does Jamie know that there is an afterwards, which once again establishes that he's not able to see the future, but he knows that there is really only one line of events that can take place.
And what is the point of Theon in that scene? Nothing...  \n\nAnd you haven\u2019t addressed my point that things only happen because characters do ridiculously out of character things. Also him causing Hodor literally establishes that if he wants, Bran can affect any timeline he pleases.
dude, the mountains were just outside KL would have you believed back then that some seasons after there would've been a desert just outside the city?\n\nI 100% agree with you, it's obvious, but they showed us they can subvert expectations. The show is over, we will never know.
Probably best to not compare season 8 with the other seasons. They rushed season 8 to the point that they had to change entire map layouts to make rushing easier.
>You presented no argument\n\ni said the last season is \"objectively\" bad. that is a statement of an argument.\n\n>Again, why would I engage with you \n\nyou're still replying lmfao. you've spent 10x the time not saying anything than you could have spent actually engaging with a discussion and presenting an opinion. is this what you do with everything in real life? just sit on the fence until you see one side being the most popular? do you have no real opinions for yourself? you just stutter and stall when someone asks you to explain your beliefs because they aren't really yours?
> i said the last season is \"objectively\" bad. that is a statement of an argument.\n\nSo, not an argument. Got it.\n\n>Again, why would I engage with you\n\n>>you're still replying lmfao.\n\n*Engage in an argument with you about the show*. Yea, I clearly explained this. You're not all that bright, are ya?\n\n>  you've spent 10x the time not saying anything than you could have spent actually engaging with a discussion and presenting an opinion.\n\nI don't do that with people who cannot argue with integrity. Talk about an exercise in futility.\n\n>  just sit on the fence until you see one side being the most popular?\n\nNo, I call out people for having insultingly ignorant positions, such as yourself. \n\n> do you have no real opinions for yourself? you just stutter and stall when someone asks you to explain your beliefs because they aren't really yours?\n\nI have lots of opinions. I've no reason to share them with you at the hopes of objective discourse, because you cannot do such a thing. You cannot argue with integrity. You just label people who disagree with you as being mentally challenged. You do not have an argument, just ad hominem attacks. \n\nAlso, lol @ your comment being removed. Hopefully that gives you the slightest clue about how inappropriate it is to say the things you've said.
Your argument that it only happens because of \"out of character\" things is invalid because it only works on the meta level. In the story itself characters can't act \"out of character\" because whatever they do IS their characteer.\n\nThe Hodor argument though is convincing imo.
These surveys made the series even more fun to watch - thanks for making them!
Keep in mind, the online backlash started with the Dorne storyline and how Stannis was written in season 5.\n\nThen season 7 had it's own set of problems with concerns like instant teleportation that was dismissed as \"nitpicking\". Took awhile but it finally bubbled up
I don't understand how people could dismiss the teleportation during the entire journey beyond the wall.\n\nApparently all this can happen within a day: Gendry can run back to the wall (since when are blacksmiths good runners?), send a raven, said raven flied to Dragonstone and Daenerys managed to fly north and also find them. All within a day (or less or more, we honestly don't know as time basically doesn't exist in the show anymore).
The IMDB scores are pretty rough too. The 6 episodes from Season 8 are in the lowest 6 spots in the overall episode ranking.
Have you seen the score on Rotten Tomatoes as well? Ouch!
It may not be the worst episode but it\u2019s significance in the story will always cause people to treat it more harshly. This is literally the episode that brings everything to a close, everything you have been hoping for over the past 8 years. \n\nBran becoming king was so left field and a nonsensical decision. It wasn\u2019t early and make the whole story feel empty.
I disagree, I think this really was the worst episode ever. It was a really terrible episode, the only ones that give it a run for its money were in this season.\n\nSeasons 1-4 were great, Seasons 5-6 were a drop-off in quality but we're talking a dropoff from a fantastic show to just a pretty good show. Season 7 was where it started to becoming really mediocre, but mediocre still isn't *awful.* And there aren't any episodes from seasons pre-S7 that specifically stand out to me as being bad on their own.
You liked the sand snakes confirmed
I agree, the journey beyond the wall is the stupidest and worst episode(s) in the entire show (and whichever the episode in which that Dorne girl said \"You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy\", fuck that episode.)\n\nFuck that episode was filled with teleportation, plot armor, plot convenience, and it was just a dumb mission from the beginning.\n\nLiterally all it did was to give the NK a dragon so that he could destroy the wall, that was the writers' purpose of that journey.
That \"Why do you think I came all this way?\" line *really* pissed people off.
Yes. For someone who doesn't \"want\", he showed particular arrogance about taking the throne. I would say he wanted it very much.
He picks when he wants to be a Stark and when he wants to be the raven at the plot\u2019s convenience.
As it should have. You can\u2019t just put in a sinister line like that, accompany it with upbeat triumphant music *and then never mention it again!*!  \n\nWe still know fuck all about Bran. When has wanting power or wanting the throne ever been a part of his character? When has he ever been shown to be a master manipulator of anything? (And no the dagger doesn\u2019t count, you can make that argument but it was never explicitly stated he had any other reason for giving it to Arya other than because he\u2019s a cripple). What was the point of his warging? What was the point of his time altering abilities? What was the point of him learning Jon\u2019s heritage? Aside from very very brief visions of what appears to be the sept explosion and Drogon flying over KL *nothing* else implied he knew the future and was manipulating events?  \n\nYou took a crippled boy with inexplicable powers, gave him an incredible journey which included arguably the shows most powerful scene (Hold the door), and then turned him into a pointless emotionless robot who\u2019s abilities or motivations are never explained in the slightest, and the sum of his contributions to the plot are being used as bait so the entire overarching plot of the show can be shanked out of existence by a teleporting teenage girl, and then being elected king for even more mind boggling reasons.  \n\nI mean pretty much none of the main characters had satisfying arcs in the end, but Bran was definitely the worst
Its so 2000's action movie ending line.
The 60 seconds later says to Tyrion that he doesnt want to be king.\n\nGet the fuck out of here you stupid prick. If you didnt want it why come all this way?..... and then no fucker pulls him up on that!!!!\n\n Fuck me the script was bad.
Bran is the true villain at the end of this series who got the Iron Throne by doing practically nothing and letting hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians die, it's infuriating
Yeah especially since this Lad had no I mentions of being king or a Lord
I dont fucking know. Cus your sisters rolled your ass all the way here while you stared blankly at people.
And then when he appoints Tyrion as hand and Tyrion says he doesn\u2019t want it, bran says \u201cand I don\u2019t want to be king\u201d. ??????????
well blame the show writers for not showing us when he revealed information to different people throughout the show. my favorite example was the ending of Littlefinger, based on everything we were shown up to the point we were led to believe LF was going to get his way, please tell me Arya didn't check with Bran to learn the truth. She recognized just what he could do the day they met under the tree.\n  \nIt simply can be put to down to he told who needed to know and only them but its not beneficial to the audience to know what is going to happen so we cannot be shown interactions with Bran for that reason. \n  \nthat last line is probably just par for the course with regards to writing quality
I liked it lol
Hes worse than Frodo at this point
> That \"Why do you think I came all this way?\" line really pissed people off.\n\nThat's something I dont get; I personally saw it as more of a \"I knew I had to become the king and so thats why I'm here\" not as a power craving \"yes I came because I wanted to be king\" kind of line. Maybe I'm the one that's wrong though but to me it makes a lot more sense, especially with the \"upbeat triumphant\" music.\n\nI've also assumed from the start that the 3ER is not evil and just does what he's supposed to do, with no hidden motives, so maybe that's also why I assumed it was a positive line.
Worst Line and scene of the whole show.
Well I mean, it speaks for itself
It was an insanely stupid line, considering like two episodes ago he said he couldn\u2019t be lord of anything. The writers must really think the audience was dumb.
when I read the leaks, I was shocked, he was the last on my list to get the Iron Throne. I thought it'd be Gendry because he got legitimized, and surely there must be an actual reason for that other then Daenerys gaining more loyal soldiers. But then I thought, there hasn't really been any build-up whatsoever indicating Gendry with leadership skills so he can't be the king. Neither can Tyrion, it'd be hella awkward if that happened. But for Bran to be the chosen one, never in a million years would I thought him as a candidate lmao.
Tyrion being left out of the story was the worst of the worst for me. Literally makes no sense.
The thing is, he had the potential to be the most interesting. Instead of wasting so much time with his story we could have spent it getting to know him and his powers. Is the 3ER good? Does he still feel? What does he want? How do his powers work? Why does he act the way he does? Doing so could have made the White Walkers more interesting too.\n\nThe problem is he ended up being a dull and poorly explained character. Him taking the throne could have been interesting, but it just ended up seeming stupid. I wonder if the showrunners only found out he was king later on and mistakenly downplayed his arc.
I just don\u2019t understand why the OG 3ER had so much more emotional scale than Bran did once he became the 3ER. Fucking robot.
I agree. Although even if they found out later about Bran being king they honestly could have cut out the Brienne/Jamie, Arya/Gendry, Bronn/Tyrion scenes and given us a couple 3ER scenes, or just added a few more minutes. Not that I have an issue with any of these scenes, I just don't understand why they'd add these subplots that are relatively unimportant to the story when, clearly, there was something extremely important about the 3ER. There's actually a lot more about the 3ER in the books so it's not like they didn't have extra material to work with.

Who was the first King of Seven (sorry Six) Kingdoms to be selected by popular vote.   Damn this script.  Damn it all to hell.
What did you expect? He did literally nothing significant entire series and then he's being crowned as king lmao.
He never did anything and for whatever reason he got the throne... Hell, Three Eyed Raven and didn't do anything special except being stoned and flying around with a raven and killing Hodor...
No, he's just the least people's favourite. For all you know he could be everyone's 2nd best.
Really. Bran.
Fewest*
:|
He absolutely 100% was the least popular before the final episode, aside from Rickon who was just a footnote. I don't know anybody who was particularly interested in or cared about Bran at all. On top of that, we don't know dick about his powers, really, and they were never particularly useful in any way, despite the show spending plenty of time on him.\n\nI think the last episode pissed people off enough that they voted Rickon over him just out of spite.
He's the new Joffrey.
[https://twitter.com/vornietom/status/1130522571210838016?s=20](https://twitter.com/vornietom/status/1130522571210838016?s=20)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis person gave a wicked Bran theory that makes him a lot more exciting.
Everyone's seen that theory, and it was made a before that person rambled on it. Was on ASOIAF after Episode 3.
He was an odd choice... no leadership experience and no charisma
Because his character serves zero purpose to the show than to utter dumb bullshit and state off into the distance.
Well that's because they turned him into a creepy, almost inanimate part of the set for the past two seasons. What made GoT great was its dynamic characters and complicated plot, which he was not only left out of most of the end of the series, but also apart from for most of the middle. His story was always tangential, then non-existent, then they made him king. What?!
How dare you say that about our king!
Forget Rickon, even Dickon is more popular than Bran
Rickard.
Ser Pounce is more popular than Bran
Everyone likes a good Dickon :)
It's still called seven kingdoms. I think.
They said Lord of the Six Kingdoms multiple times
Dude you spelled vagetreble wrong
Vegeterrible*
Vegemite
They didn't bother to even try and bring Catelyn back either as the one ghost character
Unpopular opinion. But I think Bran is great. Even better in the books.
Protest vote? I can only read it as someone saying \u201cI don\u2019t like any Stark in the show\u201d
This is an insult to my boy Ned, who died long before his character could be ruined.
Nailed it. The other Starks turned into caricatures of themselves.
1. Most people weren't terribly interested in Bran before he went all 3ER\n\n2. When he went 3ER, he lost literally all of his personality and he became one of the least interesting characters to watch on the show.\n\n3. Bran getting his powers ate up a lot of screen time and was, in the end, almost entirely pointless - which was already making people like him less and less as the series closed out, but then the \"Bran is king now because why not\" twist at the end pissed off enough people that they probably voted Rickon just out of spite.\n\nRegarding Catelyn: I think it's just that most people would vote other Starks (who are still alive) over her, and there are also probably fans who started watching later on and may have missed her entirely. Ned, conversely, was a fan-favorite character in the short term he was around, got a LOT of screen time then, and he's also probably the vote for people who want to express \"I preferred the old show.\"
Just wait until Grrm finishes Winds. Rickon will bring Unicorns to Westeros and fucks Ramsay's army.
Shaggy dog was pretty bad ass so it's a package vote I suppose
The same way ghost is so loved. Characters that D&D just forgot about for seasons at a time
I think because everyone hates Bran *that* much they probably chose Rickon out of spite, which I can\u2019t say I blame them .
> While I'm not exactly surprised that Bran is the least favorite, how the hell did Rickon get so many votes? He was the most useless Stark of them all.\n\nI liked Rickon in the books and show. \n\n A lot of the child characters got aged up significantly for their roles in the show and go on to do a lot within the story and travel the kingdoms, meeting different people (as high lords would). \n\n Rickon is just a child who has (hasn't?) grown up as he witnessed his father leave, all of his brothers leave (Not sure how he viewed Jon) and got stuck in Winterfell with his crippled older brother and Theon. \n\n He was the innocent character who just wanted a normal life and couldn't really comprehend everything that was happening and just wanted to be with his older brother (Bran) and to grow up.
> Catelyn should have beaten him at least \n\n&#x200B;\n\n My brain glitched and took this as: If Catelyn had beaten up her son, he would've been less useless.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(Whelp, guess who's getting sterilized. /s)
I was pretty disappointed that her ability to steal faces never came into play again. Just like a lot of things it leaves you wondering \u201cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201d
Poor writing; and two folks who probably wanting to go play Star Wars. How'd they take how many years between seasons to fuck not only the cast and show over, but the writing and fans. HBO should never be given the reigns of something lile this. HBO; we know how to write 4 good seasons of a series; then we just don't know\"
Hey, she is badass.  That is how she recognized that a genocidal lunatic was a killer.
\"I know a killer when I see one\"\n\nPeople who torch entire cities tend to be killers yes....\n\nGreat observation
\"Woah now Arya, I'm just supposed to take your word for that?  I'm going to need at *least* a 20 page paper with citations.\"
after being ok with her brother bending the knee to the very same person.
People eat that shit like burrito.
But people eat that shit up.  That's the exact kind of lame that spawns Twitter worship.
I agree. The \"I might die, I like a boy, boink boink boink, all night long\" facade was pretty tiring too.
What? She was scared or crying on screen for half the season?\n\nPlus, the question asked who was your favorite Stark overall not your favorite Stark in a poorly written season.\n\nIt's not surprising when you consider: \n\n1. Tywin/Arya scenes are some of the best in the entire series \n\n2. Arya/The Hound is the best pairing in the show and their scenes are also amongst the best\n\n3. Maisie gave the best performance of all of the Stark kids in the better seasons and was the only one amongst them to get an Emmy nomination. \n\n4. I don't think Arya has a single boring moment in her arc from season 1 through her arrival in Braavos(Harrenhall, list of names, Yoren, The Brotherhood, The Hound, Tywin; etc. is brilliant). \n\n5. The Frey Massacre  is an excellent fan service moment \n\nI didn't like the way she was written in season 7 and season 8 was only slightly better but she'll always be my favorite Stark on the strength of seasons 1-4 alone.
What? She was still fucking great. Especially when she killed the Night King. She saved the fucking world.
Yeah Cat is the most underrated character, maybe in anything. The most well acted, super complex with a mix of flaws and great/badass/emotional traits, just an all around fantastic character.
Yeah, if you take Cat out of the show, the whole thing kind of falls apart
You have to admit, she was kind of a bitch...
Yeah and dany was insane, Jon was stupid, Geoffrey cruel, Tommen weak, Tywin ruthless.  Each characters qualities whether they be likable or not contributed to this amazing story. So I admire them all the same, what\u2019s there to admire about rickon? Kid came up with the by far worst name for his wolf and didn\u2019t know how to zig zag he made absolutely no contribution to the story.
As a person or a character ? I didn\u2019t love her but I as a lot of respect for her.
I agree - the wight hunt was completely pointless in retrospect. Cersei didn't send any of her forces, and they easily won even without her help. Thoros and Benjen died for absolutely nothing.
It was pretty pointless at the time, not just retrospect. What about Cersei made it seems like she would be convinced? It was pretty clear that the writers knew they wanted the NK to have a dragon and had to reverse engineer a plot to make that happen. And thus Dumb Plan (TM) was born.
It would have made a hell of a lot more sense if they planned on leading the wight through the streets of King\u2019s Landing, helping Dany to look like the protector of the people. \n\nCersei could then send her army north, but only so far as the Neck to stop the Northern Coalition from coming south. History repeats itself but in reverse when it becomes clear that the Neck can\u2019t hold against dragons - Cersei and the Lannister army retreat to King\u2019s Landing and the Golden Company gets wiped out at the Neck. \n\nThen they don\u2019t have to change too much from the general trajectory of the plot other than covering up stupid mistakes (like Dany forgetting about the Iron Fleet). It would have made a neat dichotomy between Dany coming to King\u2019s Landing as the protector of life and then coming to the city as the harbinger of death. \n\nAgain, I think that a lot of problems this season come down to the fact that too much was crammed in in too few episodes and seasons. Let Dany\u2019s desire to be feared rather than loved take up more than 30 minutes of screen time. Make Tyrion\u2019s desperate desire to be loved and accepted by his sister, and guilt over killing Tywin, serve as his justification for trusting Cersei so much. Just give the audience and the characters time to breath and act like real people.
Easily won? Only if you know you have plot armor. Hopefully the characters aren't aware of the existence of D&D
I get we needed more time for the turn of Dany; but damn. They wasted 1 full episodes on pointless grobble in episode 1. The army of the dead can move stupid fast in battle. Yet they march super slow?
That episode sucked after the ending lol.
> completely pointless\n\n\nI agree, but an argument can be made that the wight hunt convinced Dany that the NK & AotD needed to be defeated.
It's called bad writing. I will never recommend this show to anyone because every storyline gets thrown out the window for big budget and looks in S8. Entire show ruined in 6 episodes they should at least get an award for that.
I mean, just because it didn't work doesn't mean it was the wrong decision. They needed ALL the help they can get. This was their only hope of getting her to fight with them. It didn't work. Sometimes you gotta take risks.
It convinced Jamie to go north.  His presence clearly motivated Brienne.   \n\nWithout Jamie,   Winter fell is overrun quicker, and The Night King kills Bran before Arya can Air Jordan.
Realistically they should have just asked Cersei for a truce so that everyone could complete final preparations for winter. Both sides have been devestated by war,  the wagon train raid showed that King's landing was at real risk of being starved out. EDIT not saying that would have worked either, but it would have been a lot easier than some crazy raid to capture a white.
Don\u2019t forget Viscerion
Man, if Emilia Clarke was my aunt, you wouldn't even have to ask me twice.
So, it is all about cocks in the end as Jaime admits in S7E1
Dumbest story of the series..still ridiculous how that episode got good ratings and reviews
It was much more ridiculous than anything this season
 \"not taking one for the team and fucking his aunt\" lmfao
It depends. Do we judge a decision by the information available to the characters at the time, or with full hindsight? Some good decisions turn out horribly...
Not only was it a bad decision in the show, it was also a terrible decision by the writers. S07E05 is precisely the episode where the whole show goes to shit and never recovers.
Even someone with half a brain would have realized that Cersei has no reason to help, even if the WW are real. And when you think that the one that came up with this plan was Tyrion, the one tormented by Cersei from his birth (according to Oberyn) and who was presented since the beginning as a very smart character that also knew what kind of person Cersei is, is even more mind-boggling.
Telling Jon who his parents are has to be up there.
And then the dead dragon was hyped up in the finale of season 7 and then it really did nothing after that.  What a damn let down so many of these plots were\n\nIt was such a stupid plan and stupid writing I thought the only logical thing (at first) was Tyrion was manipulating them somehow for the good of his own house.  Now I realize it\u2019s just shitty writing
You didn\u2019t even need hindsight to know it was the worst decision. The wights aren\u2019t smart. Set a trap, come back in the morning. Boom! Got yourself a scary dead guy! Or maybe send more than like 6 guys to get em.
Catelyn arresting Tyrion wins.
What a dumb bitch, that one. She did not deserve my man Ned.
So the conclusion was that the D makes the world spin? :P
Worst thing about that wight hunt is they could have easily just not burnt the next dead watchman or something. No need to have a whole big storyline about it.
Idk planning to put a huge proportion of the living army into an unarmed cavalry charge is mighty dumb. At least there was reasoning with Beyond the Wall.
All she wanted was the D and he didn\u2019t deliver. Moral of the story: Satisfy your woman and she won\u2019t go out and kill a million people.
Note: wight hunt only exists to extend the final season into two smaller seasons. \n\nFor an addendum to the close second, can we add not giving any dialogue to Jon for  exposition on his feelings (or lack thereof?) for Dany? Totally unclear to me whether he lover her or not... or maybe that's the intent? Dany: \"Jon loves me, Jon loves me not, Jon loves me, Jon loves me not...???\"
I dunno. Tywin not locking the toilet door behind him was a pretty bad mistake.
Plus Jon Snow himself goes on this daring, wacky mission. Yeah it puts a character in there everyone cares more about so there's dramatic tension, but that's pretty pointless to have him in the party logically.
This will happen  \ud83d\udc4d
You rock!
Maybe make a post where you take some suggestions for different questions / answers?
You\u2019re the best!
Also, one question should be \"Do you think S8 made the previous seasons less interesting for you?\"\n\nPlus, at \"Who was the most interesting villain?\" you should clearly add Bran :P
Top draw.
I can't wait.
Well he could just, you know, return to Winterfell. There's nothing really forcing him to go North after Greyworm leaves. Even his \"exile\" makes no sense.
Actually shouldn't he be able to? Sansa doesn't bend the knee to Bran so Winterfell can do whatever the hell they want.
Does he even want to return to Winterfell? He and Sansa never seemed particularly close in the show, and that was before she betrayed his trust.\n\nAlso, without White Walkers the North isn't quite as horrible a place to live. The final shots even suggested it was starting to thaw.\n\nBeing a wildling might not be so bad, all things considered.
Yeah he loved being a wildling in the early seasons
I was one of the people who said Jon the Just. I thought I was clever. Apparently not.
>ttyl\n\nExcept not because they\u2019ll be too busy ruining Star Wars.
That's already been done.
Probably that describes the notes GRRM gave them...
No shit, their job as writers was to fill in the gaps and create a compelling story that achieved the bullet points given by GRRM. They failed spectacularly.
It's clear the writers just wanted to be done with the show and move on to other projects. That's the only explanation I have for this cluster fuck.
that's not a scoop, it is known
I think it was more that he was weird and I never cared about his story and then some how he magically became the most important person in Westeros for the dumbest reason in the dumbest way. Plus the other Starks were more entertaining and had better stories/arcs
See I found Brans's story line to be the most mysterious & intriguing throughout the entire show, but yeah they ended it horribly.
Rickon?
bUt hE hAs ThE bEsT sToRy ThOuGh
Even before becoming the 3ER i feel his story line was always the least talked about, it just felt so disconnected from everything else and his characters was always kind of boring, the only likeable things in his arc were Hodor and Summer.
Don\u2019t forget about Jojen and my girl Meera. I liked them when they were around.
Bran's storyline was one of my favorites before the whole Hodor climax. It had a fun supporting cast in Osha, the Reeds and Hodor, and the mystery of what the White Walkers are and what his visions mean was interesting. It's just the conclusion that sucked.
I haven't known anybody who ever really gave a shit about Bran. He was more popular than Rickon, but only because Rickon barely existed. They spent so much time on Bran, he became the 3ER and lost literally all of his personality, and in the end him becoming the 3ER ultimately just felt kind of pointless anyway. Rickon beating him out was just a spite vote I think, but if you removed Rickon from the poll he would have been last no matter what at any point.
That wad the main problem of GoT - the storylines werent connected. This also led to the biggest disappointment with the almost meaningless battle for Winterfell and the death of the NK. \nAnd all they did to connect the two plots was making Bran the king?
Not to mention completely stupid and illogical.\n\n\"I'm not Brandon Stark anymore\"\n\n\"I'm the Three-Eyed Raven\"\n\n\"I'm no one\"\n\nThen in S8E6\n\n\"Bran the Broken!\"\n\nLike wtf.
[deleted]
>\"I'm no-one.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeason 5 No-Show Bran trained with Faceless Men confirmed.
> It just felt so forced\n\nYup. I don't ever recall seeing him transition from normal Bran in training to emotionless Bran. One seen he is normal, the next scene we see him he is emotionless. No transition, no clear or well illustrated reason, just forced.
Yeah, I think D&D went for unpredictability for the sake of unpredictability. No one predicted Bran because no one thought such an inane character would be picked as king. But D&D didn't realize unpredictability alone doesn't make a good story.
I think the intention was to make him like a puppet figure and have the real power be those who rule on the board, so nobody is actually truly with sole power. But even then, still weird.
I had to vote him because I thought back and realized how much I liked his character. I loved that he was filling the role his father left and marching to war to save his father
He got rated behind Sansa... WTF?\n\nPeople need to go back and rewatch seasons 1-4. Before the show's writing took a turn.\n\nRobb's story came to a tragic end yes, but his character, his flaws, and his greatest mistakes were all beautifully written.
I'd argue Robb suffers from being to similar to Ned. I chose Ned but Robb would've likely been #2(possibly Jon).
Amen.
There's not going to be any spinoffs based on this era of GoT.
I can easily see them doing a spinoff with older Arya, especially if the prequels go well. Casuals will love the idea and HBO will make bank.
No spinoffs for the main cast or anyone from this timeline.
Maybe there\u2019s like a weird limbo of nothing-ness if you die but are meant to be brought back to life? Definitely would have had some plot conflicts but plot didn\u2019t matter much in the 8th season anyway
Also, a lot of the storylines of the Starks were influenced by Ned and his teachings to his children. He let Arya start training, set Sansa up with her \"dream guy\", taught Jon and Robb about integrity and honor.
Agree. I feel like the true overall winner of the GOT is ned. You canclearly see his philosphy and actions ripple through the rest of the story ajd characters whilst tywins on the other hand led to the demise of most of his family other than tyrion who killed him.
Very true.
Were people counting the young Ned flashback scenes when they voted? They're brief but I didn't even think about that. I was only thinking of Sean Bean's portrayal.
Seen Been is that dude
He played Ted Snark
he is a lovely human Bean
I always thought him throttling LF was kind of a dick move, but overall he was cool. Earned my vote.\r\rHis speech when he's talking with Varys in the dungeon is one of my favorite scenes in the show.\r\r> You think my life is some precious thing to me? That I would trade my honor for a few more years of... Of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and learnt it well. I grew up with soldiers. I learned how to die a long time ago...\r\rChills. So good. Also kind of meta in that it's Sean Bean delivering it lol.
It\u2019s an interesting motivation for why he refused to let go of his honour. But what about his children? Was he fine that they would be left alone in Kings Landing with no one else to care for them? That was incredibly selfish what Ned did in hindsight.
When I saw that combination, I thought that would be the least likely to happen considering that Jon will not leave the north anytime soon and Arya will definitely stay as far away from the freezing cold as possible
It won't be freezing cold, grass was starting to grow, you could see a sprouting plant when Jons walking North
Everyone will meet everyone again except Arya who will never return imo.
I mean she will just end up in Essos. It's well established in the lore that the world of Asoiaf is round, and that if you go west of westeros you end up in Essos.
I thought the same about Arya (only that she would die because she didn't find land), however I was left with a feeling that none of the other would meet again at all. Though Sansa may travel north and surprise me and Jon or if she were to go to KL because of some obligatory event\n\nIt only felt like Jon and Arya were close-knit too me
I don't think people went by logic, but by the feel the series left them with. To be honest, a lot of stuff in this season (way too many) were illogical at best.
Indeed. I hate the excuse that \"This is a fantasy series with dragons and magic, it doesn't have to make perfect sense!\" Even in a fantasy setting, a story still needs to adhere to basic internal rules, such as the laws of physics, logic, common sense, and consistency with the story's *own established lore and character development.* \"Suspension of disbelief\" isn't limited to just imaginary creatures.\n\nAt the very least, seasons 7 and 8 needed to be full, 10-episode seasons to give the story room to breathe. Ideally, it should have gone on for 9 full seasons, and with D&D replaced as writers if they made it clear they weren't willing to put in the effort anymore.
there was too much fan service in this season and it really wrecked timing and how scenes played out by the end. Instead of missing pieces of the story we got fan service scenes and that did not benefit anyone
Maybe the North is what's west of Westeros.
It would be funny if Arya has every intention of seeing Jon again but didn't want Sansa or Bran to know she was planning on coming back to westeros to visit.
We've seen people teleporting all over the place, distance is not a hindrance in Westeros
They hatin' on my boy Tyrion by not giving him a redhead dreamy queen. They even hinted at getting their marriage back on track during the battle of Winterfell
Bran and Jon are the second most likely to meet besides Bran and Sansa, the others have like, zero chance IMO. Arya is gone for good, flat out. Even if she doesn't die a horrific death like she would in the books for trying to sail west, there's no way she'd ever come back or make the journey back. \n\nJon is going north and has zero reason to go back south, the only person he might ever interact with is Bran, if Bran retires and also returns to beyond the wall to live in a tree again. \n\nSansa will likely meet with Bran for diplomatic stuff and maybe visits, but she'd never go beyond the wall or out to see
I voted for Bran and Jon as one of the more likely ones in case they find out something else about the White Walkers and Children.
Yeah they did. They fought against the Greyjoys together. I believe Rob said it had been 9 years or something like that since they'd seen each other; Robert's rebellion ended 17 years prior.
To be fair though, that was back when Westeros was much larger, a trip from Winterfell to Kings Landing took quite a while. Westeros has gotten much smaller, it's like less than a day trip to get to Kings Landing apparently
Oh yeah! Still only once in 17ish years though, and Bran and Sansa wouldn't travel to fight in rebellions.
YOU'RE THE KING'S HAND! YOU'LL DO AS I COMMAND, OR I'LL FIND ME A HAND WHO WILL!
I think Sansa and Jon will have the best chance to happen considering that they're not that far away from each other
I get the feeling both really don't like each other. Sansa basically spent three seasons undermining Jon and ended up with his title at the end of it.
Politics and cooperation would bring them together though.
Bran is an evil, smug little shit with the voice of somebody from Hull.
I've been saying for 5 days now that while there are legitimate gripes with this season (the pacing), like 90% of the whinging is contrived circlejerk from people who just weren't paying enough attention to get through the (unfortunately) faster pacing.\n\nExhibit A.
This really is the correct answer because:\n\n* Arya and Jon are the 2 Starks that the majority of everyone cares about\n* The relationship between Arya and Jon is one of the most popular relationships on the series and even their reunion was the most anticipated reunion for Season 8 so people just like thinking of them together and hanging out
I'm one of those who voted for Jon+arya as most likely reunion and don't see my reasons listed in these comments so will explain myself.\n\nFirst let's get suspicions of positive bias out of the way: I don't really like any of the starks that ended up alive, found them all annoying for various reasons (i did like jon and arya at one point but grew sick of them in later seasons), so it's not about me being fans of those characters and being hyped about reunions. If you had to twist my arm and force me to name a fav stark of the survivors it would be Sansa who I used to despise but ended up neutral towards her because her cattiness made me lol and her evolution into a grown up mean girl made sense, only stark that wasn't ruined in my eyes. \n\nSo why did I say I believed Jon and Arya are most likely to meet up one day? Because they are the only ones who actually like each other enough to go through the trials necessary to find each other. For all the talk about the Starks being a pack, I honestly felt they didn't care much about each other at the end.\n\n\\-Bran Stark: isn't likely to travel from KL and view him as a hands off king who will spend his time warging and giving cryptic advice whilst letting the council do the heavy lifting, occasionally indulging in 4d chess moves. I don't see him becoming nostalgic for his family or even caring much for anything anymore so the odds of him visiting any of the others is remote. If he does want to see his family, he will just warg and spy on them and be done with it and i'd hardly call that a reunion especially when the other party doesn't even know he is there.\n\n\\-Sansa: doesn't actually like any of her surviving siblings, tolerates them at best. And she is queen of her own kingdom now so will be plenty busy managing her affairs and continuing the stark line (once she has kids she will have even less inclination to travel north to visit jon, who again, she doesnt care for that much to begin with, so they could be close together geographically speaking or on opposite sides of the world, it's not likely to happen). Any contact she will have with bran will be via intermediaries and ambassadors, it is unlikely Sansa will ever travel south again and Bran won't be going north either as explained above.\n\nJon: Is actually the most sociable of the surviving starks which kind of says it all...And the dude is so ned like that he won't break his oath and will stay in the north, so won't be visiting sansa even if he really wanted to.\n\nAnd being with the wildlings he might be hard to find, I just don't see queen sansa mucking around in the untamed north risking herself to find jon for a friendly chat.\n\nWhich leaves me to...\n\nArya: Yes she is last seen sailing away, but unless she dies at sea (and she is such a fan favorite i'd find that end a bit anti climactic, though perfectly in line with what GoT used to be) then chances are ONE day, even if its in 40 years time, Arya will come back to westeros even if its for a short nostalgia stay.\n\nAnd which of the starks would she go see? Jon of course, they are the only 2 to have a bond that might endure the test of time.\n\nAnd unlike Sansa, I can actually picture a seasoned Arya being able to trek across the north to find Jon wherever he might be. If she survived her boat ride, that should be ez pz.\n\nAnd that is why I voted Arya+Jon most likely reunion over sansa+jon (who are not even that \"close\" btw, the north is huge and jon isn't likely to have a fixed address that makes finding him easy) or sansa+bran (they have 0 desire to meet and neither would want to move from their respective kingdoms). That was my tldr of the day!
Very well said!

Confirmed, there were TWO that said that
Kings Landing was an inside job. Bran knew about it before it happened. Dragon fire cannot melt steel beams.
I like your thinking. This even fits with that useless white horse at the end of Episode 5.
Yea it was pretty stupid how the last scene of E5 is Arya leaving on the white horse, and then her first scene in E6, she's still in the city, but on foot, and the horse is never seen again. Wtf was the point?
[deleted]
\\>Only one thought in mind\n\nHey, he was also thinking about fucking the queen.
Maybe that was by the by. 88% of people agreed that he knew Kongs Landing (thanks to op who first wrote the typo) would burn. If he knew it, why not try to stop it? Maybe don\u2019t tell Jon about his parents?
Its sort of like Dr Strange, but evil.
/u/Grochen
[deleted]
Neither option is in any way established in the series.
Do you watch Marvel movies? I'm trying to be vague in case you don't. They are referencing that.
After reading someone else accidentally calling it Kongs Landing I can\u2019t help but refer to it that way now.
I think you\u2019ve hit the perfect episode.
I'm so glad people keep making this typo.
I'm telling you, if the show ended with a scene of Jon finding a WW spiral and a shot of just Bran the show would have a VERY different story
Yes! That\u2019s what I think! I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s what the writers intended, let\u2019s face it probably not, but it\u2019s right there in the script!
I dont think that says he's evil at all. He might either be 1. neutral and just goes with the literal flow (of time), and does what he SHOULD do based on what he's seen, or 2. he's a good guy and alternates the future for the best result. Yeah a million people died, but maybe that was actually the lesser of two (or a thousand) evils, and that's why he \"let it happen\".\n\nOf course, yes, maybe he IS evil, but I feel like it would make a lot less sense if he was evil imo.
Deciding that a million people should die to ensure a better future is exactly what caused everyone to say Dany was mad, and for her to be killed.\n\nSo why is it different when Bran does it? Because he knows for sure?\n\nIt\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a good answer.
Well, we never know.
A more positive interpretation is that he recognized that without him there as a compromise candidate, that meeting would have ended in another war.
Is it possible Bran was just referring to the wheelchair bound month long journey it takes to get to KL from WF? Surely he went down south knowing they would have to determine a king or queen and that\u2019s what he could have meant by that. I\u2019m not entirely sure Bran is completely all knowing. I mean I won\u2019t deny he knows who will play important roles in future events and what not but are we really going to say Bran knows everything that is ever going to happen in the future?
I really can't see travel time being referenced by the writers of beyond the wall and Teleporto-pirate...
Well of course, I just prefer the Bran as villain-take on it
I have to admit a while ago someone else accidentally wrote Kongs Landing and it really made me laugh. I can\u2019t help but refer to it as Kongs Landing now.
Even in conversation now I can\u2019t help but refer to it as Kongs Landing. Someone mentioned Cersei Lannister throwing barrels out of the red keep and it\u2019s an image I can\u2019t get out of my mind!
If that's the case, then the writing was still terrible. If the 3ER had some sinister plan all along to take the throne then they should at least have explained who he was
I agree it should have been explained which is why I\u2019m hopeful it will be explained in a prequel. I hate thinking they would take advantage of the viewer by leaving us with this hole, but the only explanation I can think of is they are saving that story. Otherwise, it is just crappy writing. \nThe only positive thing I can think of about leaving it unexplained is it allows the viewer to create their own story and fans to supply some amazing fan fiction/theories. Now that it\u2019s ended I will miss reading all the theories on this subreddit. It added an element to the show that I really enjoyed and isn\u2019t common among most shows. But that isn\u2019t for everyone so I understand the disappointment many have.
Where has it ever been said that the 3ER has the ability of seeing possible future outcomes?
I don\u2019t think it has,  but he has seen flashes of future events. When he was north of the wall searching for the 3ER he had a vision that showed a dragons shadow flying above KL and I believe in another vision he saw the Sept of Baelor explode before it happened. The 3ER really never been fully explained. So I am in error I do not know he sees all possibly outcomes. That was a far stretch on my part.  He would be able to see the past though which would have helped him decide that a Brandon was the right choice. That is only if the previous 3ER already knew of Jon\u2019s heritage. Did all the previous 3ER memories transfer to Bran? I guess if we knew that maybe we could understand the 3ER motives more?
Who said that Bran isn't Bran any more? Bran.\n\nWho then said \"Yes I am totally Bran, King Bran* actually?\" Bran.\n\nYou're taking one thing that he said as gospel while ignoring his later decisions. I can see why you'd do that, because Bran/the show as written doesn't make any sense and we're trying to make sense of it, but that's not what it is.
You\u2019re right I am taking one thing he said and making it gospel,  but I\u2019m also looking at his behavior. It really does seem after he became the 3ER that Bran does not exist anymore. For me I see Brandon Stark and Bran/3ER as different characters. There seems so little of Bran left after he became the 3ER. Unfortunately, it\u2019s left to the viewer to try and figure it out because it wasn\u2019t given time to be explained.  At least it gives us fan theories to read, but it does leave us feeling unsatisfied.
Those responses could have been the 3ER lying.
I didn't interpret it like that. He's still Bran, just not the Bran everyone knew. He's the Three Eyed Raven, but hes still \"Bran Stark\". Like...think of it in the sense that Sansa season 8 is NOT Sansa season 1. Then exemplify that by like a thousand. That's how I thought of Bran when he told people like Meera that he wasn't \"Bran\".
Yeah I think it\u2019s probably a flaw in the writing, but nevertheless it\u2019s there in the script. \u201cWhy do you think I came all this way?\u201d\nUnintentional subtext: \u201cTo be King! My plan worked! Push Danny\u2019s buttons until she snaps, let duty bound Jon kill her off and then roll in as the leader of the seven (sigh, six) kingdoms.\u201d \nRewatching the show from this perspective will really change your views on Bran\u2019s journey I think.
The \"Bran is evil\" theory relies on some really weird beliefs about the quality of D&D's writing.\n\nIn order for it to work, their writing is bad enough that the \"true\" resolution of the main plot is only conveyed through a particular interpretation of 2-3 vague things that Bran says and a particular interpretation of his vaguely defined powers, all of which completely runs against the tone of the end of the episode\n\nAND\n\ntheir writing is also good enough that the interpretation of these few lines isn't just the unintended implication of the few lines that they wrote.
lol if he shut his mouth about Jon's heritage none of this would have happened
\"It's your choice, Jon\"\n\n\"The future is written\"\n\nSo the guy who knows the future is written also tells a dude that he has a choice?
Maybe something even worse would have happened. Dany's madness seems to have been an inevitable development, so is it better to let a single city burn or save it but then Dany goes mad years down the line when she's got an empire stretching across 2 continents comprising tens of millions of people?
But Varys actively tried to stop it.
Well according to the survey 88% of people saw that.
Same. Plus that badass never lost a battle. What a stud.
He was a lot more of a dumbass in the show though. He just fell in love and abandoned his vow instead of choosing Jeyne's honor over his own after a moment of weakness when he found out his brothers were murdered. \n\nThe parallels to Ned sacrificing his own honor were a lot more satisfying.
Ned?
[deleted]
What about Ned? He might've been an honorable fool, but he knows how to keep a damn secret. Robb broke his oath and got his family and men killed.
You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain.
Should have just married the Frey girl.
Long Live Robb!
They kind of forgot about spellcheck.
Too bad Game of Thrones is over or they could all have bright futures writing for the show
Not as if they are being paid millions to do it though

It's not impossible to do at all. There are software that does this instantly with a click of a button, nVivo for example, possibly many others that are open source.
we kind of forgot about that
Are you talking about the viewers or the writers!?
yes
BuT iT wOuLd Be A tOuChInG mOmEnT
Seems like a lot of people assume the plot is going to make as little sense as the plot has made previously
Then why is everyone mad?
Especially the writers of the show \ud83d\ude48
IMO Arya has like 10% chance of even getting back to Westeros
Bran had like 0.01% chance to become King. Arya won't just be coming back, she'll tow Westereros back east with her boat.
\"You underestimate my plot armour!\"
Arya is going to die at sea. Everyone who has ever sailed west has never come back. Unless, of course, her plot armor will protect her, but if she was anyone else, she'd die.
Probably because the rulers are the two characters people care the least about. They want to see a Jon & Arya reunion though.
Of course that was the reason. People thinking with emotion and not actually answering thequestion.
Lol they\u2019re other sides of the planet, and Bran and Sansa rule the only two kingdoms in Westeros and have plenty to discuss for terms. How is the former meeting even remotely as likely as the second meeting.
The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Holy Roman Empire were bastions of peasant liberty and political stability, dontcha know? /s
\\^This comment will not receive the deserved number of upvotes.
Not going to comment on the Commonwealth as I do not know much about it, but the HRE had lots of things that were better than in the absolute kingdoms surrounding it. For example it had a semi-independent judiciary, it had free cities that were on equal footing with nobility and who could conduct their own affairs and (admittedly after huge wars) it had a degree of religious tolerance that was missing from England, Spain and France.
Couldn't help but read that as stab-ility and thought, you know what that still works.
If anything the elective monarchy would cause more problems and mean there\u2019s going to most likely be a war every time the king dies
\"The Wheel\" has always been ambiguous and stupid. Does it mean literally what Dany said where the switching of families on the throne crushes the common people? Families only ever switched once, though. Does it mean different families fighting for power, rather than the throne directly? Does it mean the way nobles treat commoners? How was anyone meant to break it? What Dany going to end all houses and rule alone? Was she going to execute any differing opinions? How would she stop scheming?\n\nNothing about it made sense.
Her speech hinted at an \"Enlightened monarchy\" and that is the only explanation that makes sense. \"The Wheel\" is as abstract as the \"Game of Thrones\" and it really looks like both are the same. Breaking the wheel at least promised taking the power from the Great houses. The reign she promised at least isn't a tyranny against commoners but having consolidated power under her breaking the feudal structure.\n\nNow with the elective monarchy the game to reach the top will become even bigger and stronger. So the wheel isn't broken but is replaced with a bigger, stronger wheel.
the last 3ER lived for like 150 years, and died because of the NK not of natural causes. it seems 3ER are almost immortal.
Because a big part of the wheel was the concept of ownership of the throne based on bloodline. Whether or not an elective monarchy would run more smoothly, that toxic idea was eliminated, with the exclamation point being Jon not getting it as the undisputed last heir.
But Bran is immortal. They have a far greater problem now. A King that can see any rebellions or attempts to usurp him coming
But that will cause more LittleFinger and Varys characters to appear and manipulate on who to become kings. And when they'll not like the king anymore, guess who's getting the poison?
But the system is still broken. Each house will still continue on the same concept and more power struggle will arise within the regions and houses as each house have a shot at the highest position. The new system is hardly innovative as the Iron Islands has the same system and it didn't work better for them.
How do you think the Paramounts will be chosen? How do you think the King in the North will be chosen?\n\nOwnership based on bloodline is still strong and that\u2019s assuming that Brans \u201celective monarchy\u201d actually stays stable, which I seriously doubt.
sources?
Also you have a monarch that has all-seeing powers. Big Brother, can see everything, and every citizen is under constant surveillance. He let King's Landing burn, and he will definitely abuse that power.
One would think that the fact that the only elective monarchy in Westeros chose none other than EURON as their King would serve as a hint against this system.
If you put Tywin in at the end of the show, it would be a Lannister monarchy within a month.
especially in this last season,  it seemed much more of a catch phrase that any type of firm plan of the future.  \n\nWhen she is inspiring the crowd and tries to get a chant going 'will you help me break the wheel'  my reaction was 'what does that even mean?'\n\nClearly, it meant to take her armies (dothraki back to horde size, and the reformed unsullied) and conquer all known lands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9Bo89m2f6g\n\nShe clearly explained it.\n\nI'm just not sure how anyone thinks it is broken
To be honest, the only way to \"break the wheel\" in this god-forsaken world is exactly what Dany was planning. If everyone is kept in line through fear, there won't be any wars or backstabbing. Dany made an example out of the people of KL, so if she actually became Queen and took over the world, people would understand what would happen to them if they attempted to revolt. She'll literally bring hell-fires down on you, as she's proven she'll go as far as she needs to go. What she did to KL tells the people that she's not afraid to kill whoever she needs to (innocent or otherwise) in order to keep the people in-line.\n\nIf she ruled the world with an Iron Fist, there would be no wars and everyone would listen to her out of fear. That's what I call \"breaking the wheel\", at least in the world of ASOIAF. If one Lord attempts to rise up against her, Drogon will literally melt their keep and kill their entire family and they won't be able to do anything about it. Very effective leadership tactic in this world imo. Daenerys Stormborn will bring her wrath whenever she needs to, which is effectively breaking the wheel.
The dothraki: \"is the queen dead? Good, whew, now we can go back to being law abiding citizens\"
The show just kind of forgot about the Dothraki.
The Dothraki just kind of forgot they all died at Winterfell, and like a Loony Tunes character when they realized they all instantly died again.
But why would he care if all the Kingdoms came down on them? They're the unsullied, facing certain death without flinching is kind of their thing.\n\nAnd why call/wait for the council at all? Why not just execute them straight away? They had Jon and Tyrion in the dungeon for weeks before all the lords arrived.
Well because Greyworm isn't *really* an Unsullied anymore. After meeting Missandei, he had all the same feelings any other character did.\n\nHe was more interested in protecting Naath for Missandei probably. After the rage of Dany's death, then the acceptance a few weeks later, I'm sure he understands
Jon definitely knew she had done wrong way before Tyrion mentioned his sisters. That\u2019s why he stopped fighting in the streets when she was burning the city.
Jon was so poorly written that it's hard to know who he was anymore. This season he seems to be utterly stupid and too in love with Dany to think clearly. At least that's what the show was pushing. He said he himself he didn't know what he'd do if he was Dany on top of Drogon in that moment. Yeah, I don't get it either. The Jon we all knew would have reacted differently. But this is season 8 where characters we knew don't make any sense anymore.
Yet in the next episode we get him arguing for her for 5 minutes before coming to his senses.
Even then Tyrion did care but he wasn't willing to make the sacrifice of abandoning his evil and bloodthirsty house and family for it until it was his life at stake.
Read the post again. They brought up democracy as an *example* of breaking the wheel. They're saying Dany's definition of the wheel remains intact after the finale.
Chill out, Marx. I'm just saying the wheel of elite families ruling over the little people hasn't changed in a television show
The wheel is the never ending changing of power from one person to another. The wheel can never be broken but the process in which who is selected to have that power can be. No longer is the changing of power happening by force but by selection. Dany was just another spoke on the wheel.
Oooo how I miss college.
She literally nothing personal kid-ed the NK.
\"Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru\" - Arya to the Night King.
personnel*
I enjoy anime and I'm certain Arya wasn't that...
felt little weird that Arya didn't use face swapping since they spent so much time for that training before. would also have been neat if Arya could've gotten near NK using some of that trick.
Exactly
How would that trick have worked against the NK? I can't think of a way. What face in her bag would have allowed her to casually get next to the NK without him or his generals knowing something was up? When you kill a WW they disintegrate so there's no face peeling ritual she can perform to look like a white walker.
I'm personally thinking the South is going to face an economic collapse and revolts soon if Bronn remains Master of Coin, but yeah the weather is better so I'd rather live there. But if the North was warmer I'd probably like to hang out in Winterfell.
I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
Bruh this kind of logic doesn't exist in the world post-ending anymore, given the lord of the other six kingdoms literally didn't have their own interests in mind at the time of Bran's crowning.
I guess the North would also pick their own ruler then? But there wold be no stark in winterfell. I honestly don't know why I care anymore anyway...
Arya would be Sansa's immediate heir, but she might be a bit difficult to reach.
I'm pretty sure men always inherit before women in every Kingdom except for Dorne, both inherit on equal grounds and the Iron Islands, in which they have their own funny little election and offerings.\n\nSo Sansa's immediate heir would be Bran. Infact, Sansa only got to be \"King/Queen in the North\" because the title didn't exist at the time and the northeners had to choose someone to lead them.\n\nOnce Sansa passes away, the title is no longer up for \"re-election\" but will instead pass on to her offspring, and in case she doesn't have offspring, her siblings and then their nephews.
I voted Arya and Jon because of the bad writing. If the show was as internally consistent or as politically savvy as the earlier seasons then Sansa and Jon or Sansa and Bran are the obvious choices.  The show no longer makes sense so I think Jon and Arya reuniting is more likely because it would be a surprise and an emotional beat for the audience.
We really don\u2019t know that. If we had access to the raw data we could look at that, and it might indeed be interesting. But speaking for myself, I complained very vocally about bad writing and I picked Bran and Sansa to reunite.
There are way more people who liked this episode (30% rated it 8+) than votes on even the most popular reunion (13%).
That's not how anonymous surveys work
There is a YouTuber named JonTron
I read somewhere that he was dying and in the process of turning but was stabbed in the heart with dragonglass by the children of the forest
Realizes she is not no one, but a Stark. Gets back home, immediately frees her wolf, tells her family she will never see them again. A lot of characters feel like in earlier season their character had progression and in 8 they had regression.
Either maisie williams or the character herself has gotten her ego inflated because she walks around in every episode like she's the fucking shit and it really annoys me
[deleted]
Literally dies and is brought back for what?  Bending the knee or killing Dany (which someone else easily could've done)
I guess he was brought back to get Dany. Nobody else from the north would have tried to seek her out. So he was a big part of why the NK was killed.
Jon and Dany were both tools for the lord of light. Jons purpose was to unite fire and ice in order to defeat the night king, which undoubtedly would not have happened without those dragons. Once that purpose was fulfilled, he needed to remove fire from the equation as no one should have that kind of power. Which he did and then he was freed to go live a duty free life in the wild. He fulfilled everything the lord of light intended him to. It was necessary for him to be targ because it would have been difficult for anyone else to eliminate dany with her dragon protecting her. His targ blood made it possible for him to get past drogon.
He was brought back because, as hinted heavily in the books, he\u2019s meant to stop the white walker threat. However, readers put this together years ago and d&d wanted to subvert expectations so they rewrote the story and made Arya the one to kill the NK... even though it makes zero fucking sense.
I feel like people are being purposefully ignorant when they say this, if not for Jon the wildlings are likely executed, Ramsey continues to rule the North, Daenerys never even considers the Great War, the Night King probably destroys Westeros. And he stops Dany from destroying the planet.\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t even need to be all of that, it could\u2019ve just been a little thing. Pretty sure there\u2019s a bit of dialogue about it before the Battle of Bastards. \u201cWhy did he bring me back?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe for a higher purpose. Or Maybe he brought you back just to die again today.\u201d \u201cWhat cruel kind of god is that?\u201d \u201cThe one we\u2019ve got.\u201d
> Viserion spits fire at him, he hides behind a rock, survives (this is even more ridiculous when you see what Drogon did to King's Landing)\n\nWe even see Viserion's fire destroy the walls of Winterfell just minutes before this scene
> Grey Worm doesn't kill him immidiately when he finds out he killed his Queen, even though he slaughtered Lannister soldiers for much less \n\nSo much this. The characters change their attitude in 0,5 secondes.
I think Jon has had the most plot armor out of any character, even more than Arya.  He should have logically died Gods know how many times after he actually did die.  In Battle of the Bastards, Beyond the Wall and The Long Night he should have died countless times.  At least in BOTB and BTW he didn't get saved by \"let's cut away to another scene\"
Drogon should have tried to burn him, even with the required retcon.  That could have given a reason for Drogon and company to not kill him but then you have his \"story\" being even more better than Bran's.
Drogon's main attack gets +80 explosive vs stone, while Undead Viserion has a passive blizzard, an AoE ability which slows nearby enemies.
>Drogon doesn't kill him even though he killed his mom\n\nHe's a Targaryen. There's a pretty strong indication that dragons inherently bond with Targaryens.\n\n>Grey Worm doesn't kill him immidiately when he finds out he killed his Queen, even though he slaughtered Lannister soldiers for much less\n\nGrey Worm seems conditioned to only act on orders from authority. The executions were on Dany's orders. Notice how when Bran put his foot down (figuratively speaking) as king, Grey Worm quieted down and followed his orders.
Targaryen dragons killed other Targaryen during their civil war. Dragons only bond with one rider.
And only killed the Waif after getting three fatal stab wounds from her in three seconds followed by an abdomen full of rank harbor bacteria.
Actually annoyed me because Drogo was killed by a small, infected wound showing that people no matter their strength can succumb to nature. Meanwhile someone who's less physically fit with worse wounds, is thrown somewhere that's extremely likely to contain harmful bacteria, and is perfectly fine rather quickly after minor treatment of the wound.
It was two stabs with a small knife in the lower right abdomen where there are no vital organs.  Infection was a possibility but not guaranteed.  I find the Hound's survival less likely than Arya's but people don't go on and on about that.
Show Arya is pretty fantastic in the first four seasons, but honestly suffers the most from season 5 and beyond. The Braavos shit is so, horrifyingly awful.
Show Arya's story went to shit in S6 and never recovered
Show Arya is my favorite. I don\u2019t like her in the books.
I still think it would of been a better choice to leave the night king to Jon, but have Arja kill Dany. In episode 5 with Arja being in the thick of the carnage, I was sure they were setting it up so she was going to kill Dany.\n\nThan again, I would of prefered Jorha to have to kill Dany, that would of been something.
I weirdly wanted her to find Melisandre's necklace and take over her position!
I honestly kept on expecting a faceless assassin to kill her at some point so that they could at least do something relevant.
That was not Arya's whole arc.\n\nEdit.  Added \"whole\".
Her getting poisoned back in Braavos and then somehow surviving because Lady Crane found her lying on the floor would make more sense than having her surviving major stab wounds in her stomach and still being able to run around and swim, like what the fuck.\n\nThe faceless men aren't even known to be stabby. They always make their kills look like accidents.
This is what pisses me off so much with Arya's storyline. I feel like she basically scammed the faceless men but everyone just acts like she completed her training and is one of them now, even though she still retains her identity, like you can't have both. Arya's story would've been way more interesting if they fully committed to her losing her identity in trying to seek vengeance but the showrunners  just wanted to play up to everyone's love of Maisie Williams.
Yea, the internet turns people into irrational hate machines.  But the hate for Arya is mild compared to for others.  Arya is the best.
It seems to have taken over Reddit after the finale and is in direct contrast to the Reddit polls.  So, I think it\u2019s a vocal minority.
I don't know about the books, but I disagree with this notion that the bullet points of the ending were fine, only the execution sucks.\n\nIn the context of the show, Bran becoming king, Daenerys going crazy and Jaime going back to Cersei are horribly unsatisfying endings. \"Oh, but Game of Thrones is not a fairytale!\"\n\nI'm not asking for fan-service, but these endings aren't bittersweet, they're downright sadistic. Daenerys' whole arc, in my view, is about her learning how to be a leader, and to reject her family's troubled history and legacy, and build her own. Does she have to end up on the throne? Not necessarily, but how does a character that has surrounded herself with multiple counselors and constanly asked for advice can have \"goes batshit insane, whatever\" as a satisfying conclusion? Why not use the fact that Jon is not only a Targaryen himself, but actually knew one (Maester Aemon) as a way to show her \"hey, not all Targaryens are conquerors or crazy, huh\"?\n\nAnd I've seen people bring up that Jaime is like an addicted who wants to get rid of it, but can't. Fine, I get the point, but... that's not narratively satisfying. You can't just have a \"tragic\" ending like that just for the sake of it. Have him kill Cersei and die in the process, it's not rocket science.\n\nThe execution was a tragedy, but the bullet points were very underwhelming too, or downright nonsensical in Bran's case. Again, at least on the context of the show, don't know about the books. Maybe it makes sense there.
> And I've seen people bring up that Jaime is like an addicted who wants to get rid of it, but can't. Fine, I get the point, but... that's not narratively satisfying. You can't just have a \"tragic\" ending like that just for the sake of it. Have him kill Cersei and die in the process, it's not rocket science.\n\nExcept that what you just said completely changes it from being tragic to palatable. It's not supposed to be easily palatable, it's supposed to leave a bad taste in your mouth, that's part of the tragedy. Jaime is like a character that has struggled with heroin for 8 seasons, and finally manages to break free in season 7, but when death is imminent you see him reach for one last hit and fall back into his addiction right before a meteor hits his house and kills him. It's bittersweet and tragic because you learn that in the end he never truly broke free of his addiction, but in the very end at least he was happy with his drug, and more tragedy because you wonder if his heroin was the only thing that ever made him feel happy, and that's why he chose it at death's door.
This is an adaptation issue and it does not make sense in the show because of how many characters and plot-lines are changed/omitted.  I fully believe these are the broad strokes of Martin's ending. The entire series was inspired by and starts with Bran's story so I believe him becoming the King is very believable in the context of the books, but came out of the left field on the show because D&D can't flesh things out like Martin does. Bran and Jon's stories are flipped on its head. Jon is the Aragorn figure with the Frodo ending while Bran is the Frodo figure with the Aragorn ending. \n\nAs for Dany, her arc was always very ominous, and there's plenty of hints in the books that she will eventually succumb to her Fire and Blood impulses, but not necessarily lose her mind like the show implied - which I think is an oversimplification of her downfall. She tries to overcome her nature of Fire and Blood by surrounding herself with advisors, but in the end, despite her attempts to make it work that just does not make her happy. Peace did not give her her ideal world - she had to reopen the fighting pits and agree to the return of slavery in the name of peace. She had to tolerate what she sees as injustice because she tried to make peace work, but it just doesn't, not for her.\n\nDany has a strong belief in her own moral code and has a giant savior complex. To her, she truly believes what she is doing is right, and if Fire and Blood is the only way she can \"save\" others and make her ideal world happen, then so be it. She decided in her very last chapter that it was time to embrace Fire and Blood, otherwise she will get nowhere. \"If I look back, I am lost\". \n\nI think the reason why people felt betrayed by Dany's heel turn, aside from the very rushed season 7-8, was the omission of the entire fake Aegon Targaryen plot line in the books. I think this will be sort of similar to her plot line with Jon in the show. fAegon will be seen as a good king, a glimmer of hope after he deposes mad queen Cersei, but Dany comes in with her army of rapers and pillagers, exiles like Tyrion and Jorah and three nukes. She sees herself as a \"savior\". But the people of Westeros don't need saving. There are no chains for her to break. Here, she's just another invader, and in Westeros she can only rule through Fire and Blood.
Totally agree.  They should have abandoned the book endings and written a good ending for the show.  These plot points were never going to work in the show no matter how many more episodes they added.
I think George will be able to do it with the final two books, but I do think it\u2019s incredibly hard to wind all of his narrative to the ending in a meaningful way which is why it\u2019s taking so long to write. The show felt very much like it glossed over all the details, so while enough the ending had enough content to make it feasible understandable, it didn\u2019t feel earned.
Yeah, I completely agree. I think that the story COULD have been fine if they would have done it the way they used to, slow and methodical. They really needed more seasons to wrap things up the way they wanted to. This way it just felt rushed and really badly executed. \n\nSeriously, this season has episodes where more big events or character twists occur than the entirety of season three or four.
He\u2019s not doing 3 books it\u2019s 2. Hell we might not even get 2 anyway.
Oh I know he is saying it is 2... I just feel like I would be astonished if it didn't turn into 3, based on how much left there is to cover. It started out as a trilogy... then 4 books... then 6... now it is supposed to be 7, but I feel like even if WoW comes out, GRRM will at some point tell us he actually is gonna need 8 books to finish the story.
I can understand that perspective, but I do think this is different than a show such as Lost or Dexter for example where the ending was conceptually unsatisfying. At least for me, the part of GOT final season that I didn\u2019t feel satisfied with was the lack of character development, meaningful dialogue, and conflict that brought the show there. It felt more like the shallow cliff notes version of the ending, which is upsetting after having so much depth to the earlier seasons. That being said, I was far more ok with how the story ends than I was with how it was told.

Like how The Long Night trivializes most of Jon's arc involving WW.
The four most intriguing story lines (Jon, Bran, Arya, NK) due to their potential outcomes will now be meaningless filler due to their actual outcome. Wtf even is this season. They somehow blew a 4-0 lead in a 7 game series. Seems impossible but they fucking did it.
Please, I'll keep injecting Hardhome straight into my veins for years to come. \n\nWhat a fucking fantastic episode.
That\u2019s like saying Eisenhower didn\u2019t do shit in WWII cause the Soviets killed Nazi.
Just because he didn't get to stab the main villain doesn't mean his WW arc is trivialized. He's still most responsible for uniting Westeros against the White Walker threat. Not to mention the major role he plays in the rest of the season.
Arya killing him is fine with Me. Jon\u2019s arc was about getting everyone together and leading the fight. He did that.
They always felt like filler to me anyway. Bran's scenes during the show were easily my least favorite. Hell, I barely even remember any of it, just dreading when the inevitable next Bran scene would be where they are all still aimlessly walking north having some meaningless dialog. \n\nArya was, in general, a great character, but she definitely had her share of filler, too. Her scenes in the House of Black and White for instance were awful. The 4th or 5th time you see her being abused and/or being ignored by Jaqen were more than enough.
The end pretty much makes irrelevant like 60-70% of the show
I\u2019m going to be so mad rewatching everything happening with Bran. He goes through so much shit, and other people around him are killed or have their minds broken to keep him alive, only to have whatever interesting mysticism linking him with the wierwood trees, the night king, the wall, the warging etc. go completely unresolved. The whole magic side of the show was left as dozens of loose ends in favor of an Arya sneak attack, then Bran who\u2019s been entirely disconnected by choice from the human political drama swoops in at the last second to become king for no reason; with no basis for why he would want it or why the rest of the lords would support him.
You could say the same about all the Margaery stuff, but in that case it doesnt feel like filler, just like a much much better exposition about how not every character will live out his whole arc
A lot of scene of other characters will start to feel like filler I bet. Problem is a ton of Bran scenes were boring before this and now they are infuriating.
Rewatching would be depressing, the first scene of the entire series is now a parody!
That makes sense honestly. Episode 2 had some super cool scenes (like Brienne's knighting) that are amazing because they are \"supposedly\" the last time you'll see all these characters alive and together. Then Episode 3 comes along, nobody in that scene dies, the Night King wasn't really that big of a deal, and all of a sudden, the previous episode loses a lot of love because much of it didn't mean anything.
Yeah, they were good, but as a setup for what came after it, they are now basically worthless...\n\nThat's also why I feel like the whole season's rotten rating looks too high now. Boosted by some ultimately insignificant setup episodes, while the ultimate payoff is rotten as can be
Speaking the truth.
Yes, I noticed that too. This downward trend started with episode 3, since then the scores have dropped lower and lower for all the episodes.
Which is fucking stupid, it\u2019s just petty brigading driven by spite. Rank the last 3-4 episodes lower all you want.
Well there's 2 reasons i can think of for that. In isolation those episodes were decent and this rated fairly highly. But after the last 4 episodes they ultimately became pretty pointless beacuse nothing really happend to further the plot.\n\nThen there's also the part of the fanbase that just retroactively downvotes everything beacuse they're angry with the finale. Like i absolutely hated the finale or atleast how things went down, i'm not gonna go back and retroactively reduce ratings like that.
I've been watching that too. We're .1 point away from not having a single episode at 8 or higher. Fascinating to watch.
Yeah... personally I skip all Ned scenes, Robb Scenes and Oberyn scenes on my rewatches...  because all that matters about ANYTHING is how it ends,  not how it lives.\n\nyeah, no.   the Night King mattered, certainly not as much as he should have, but he mattered, he killed the previous three-eyed Raven, essentially forging Bran,  wiped out the last of House Umber and Karstark, nearly genocided the wildlings, united  Jon and Daenerys armies against him,  killed a dragon, caused a good portion of the losses that caused Daenerys to go off the deep end.  and would have wiped out the entire world if not for the (admittedly clumsy) culmination of Arya's training, because Dany's army with its tens of thousands of Dothraki, Thousands of Unsullied and two dragons BARELY won, nothing would have had a chance after that, which was the trap the story fell into.\n\nJon's lineage tipped the scales of Dany's choices, her entire reason for 'choosing fear' was that Jon was clearly the more loved of the valid candidates,  his arc also emphasised the idiocy of divine right, Jon's last leadership role ended with him being stabbed to death.   it was never about his right to be king, it was always about how he neither wanted to be a king, nor was he the best suited.   his entire story was about the shift from being a bastard pariah to finding a place where he belonged, mattered and could be important to people,  he was completely swayed to the Freefolk lifestyle back in Season 3, only rejecting it out of moral obligation to the Night's Watch,\n\nthe a huge portion of the story is contingent on lies, false narratives and the conflict they cause.  the story that Rhaegar kidnapped Lyanna incited the events that culminated in Robert's rebellion,  the lies of Joffrey's parentage propagated the war of five kings,  to have Bran's ultimate destiny be that of the King who can see through these falsehoods is a strong thematic hook, it just isn't handled very well.   it doesn't ruin his story in retrospect.
Thank you. I winced with embarrassment when angry joe said Jon\u2019s lineage and resurrection didn\u2019t matter at all. Whether you enjoyed the series and execution or not, that\u2019s simply objective nonsense at best.
Yeah nobody rates shit like the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie lower just because the later ones were shit
Don't worry mate, winter is only a couple of episodes :)
[deleted]
Still cold
this is what I thought! nearly everyone agreed on bran knowing what was going to happen and still letting thousands of thousands of people get burned alive so he could sit on the throne (or just on his wheelchair by whatever is left of drogon's anguish). so why why why would anyone want to live under his rule? I think I'd rather have sansa as my queen, as she does seem to have at least some experience with these politics.
It is better to be under someone's rule like that, than to be against them.\n\nIf he were letting thousands of people die with that decision, then how many people do you think he is letting die with Winterfell's newfound independence?\n\nThe little sociopath probably knows that The North doesn't have the means to keep itself fed through winter and would rather give them their independence so that they starve to death, rather than have them stick around and be a burden to the rest of the realm.
Right. She also has the experience with the logistics of ruling. \n\nHowever, I am honestly not a huge fan of her either.\n\nJon: I need you to keep a secret.\nSansa: Ok.\nAlso Sansa: Hey Tyrion...
Does it really matter? As a commoner I'd probably live a life of whatever no matter who reigns so I'd rather live a place where it is warm.
I imagine some of the people in Kings Landing felt similarly, and Bran did nothing to stop it. \n\nIn fact, I could argue he was a contributing factor to it happening.
The only good reply I've really gotten. I hate being cold too
I wanna live in Dorne with all the bisexuals!
Also, how the hell does Westeros have control of the wall when it's in the north now?
Or being a total bitch to the Lord of the Riverlands - a region that until that moment were entirely devoted to answering the call for the Starks whenever they were in need.\n\nShe doesn't make alliances - she breaks them.
Or openly asking for independence from your brother in front of the rulers of the other Kingdoms, essentially ensuring future revolts.
The funny thing is, in terms of a rewatch, the Lannisters are by far the best to see their arcs again. Cersei literally having her house of cards fall on her. Jaime having a all too realistic relapse (it seems weird on a show, but this is exactly what addiction is like, and it's often never depicted this well) and Tyrion actually having the bittersweet ending of having a high power he doesn't want.
Plus, the big woman. And I hear she's single now.
Edmure shouldn't have spoken.  He has had nothing to offer the world besides his value as a hostage for years.  His sad sack performance at Riverrun tells you all you need to know about him
Oh yeah right, he should've let his infant child and his men be slaughtered, sure.
Yep. It's a little vindication. \n\nI really, really wish it had gone otherwise, though.
Oh yeah, I totally agree. The big thing for me is that I never really got time to dislike or question Daenerys. She was a little cold at times, but out of nowhere she torches kings landing? And they never really actually show her on the dragon once she is destroying everything. I found it hard to connect the action to her. \n\nThen 5 minutes later she is dead. It was too much too quickly.
Yeah I would give practically anything to have the series finished out strong. It was in contention for my favorite series of all time and now it can\u2019t really hold a candle to them.
Honestly, only the second episode had any real depths to it. The scene where Brienne got knighted and Pod sang is so darn good. \n\nOverall the character interactions was more than shallow one-liners.\n\nBy far the best episode this season, and the only episode I'd call good.
I wholeheartedly agree. By the time we got to the small council meeting I was pretty much over the one liners. \n\nThe second episode had some great depth (relatively) to it. It was also genuinely funny with the giants milk story lol
Why, because than you feel justified to have an opinion?
I wouldn't say that. It does make me feel more justified IN my opinion. \n\nIt also gives me people that have similar feelings to talk to about it.\n\nAnd some of the people that have spoken out against the season as a whole, have donated a good chunk of change to Emilia's charity which may or may not have happened otherwise.

> And who the fuck is Aaron Rodgers\n\nif you're actually serious he's the Packers quarterback and he was an extra in episode 5
Only 11%? Damn people here really are way to generous to this last season.
Hahahahaha, dude that was HILARIOUS! Game of Thrones is bad!!!
Always? Absolutely not. Up until ep4 where Rhaegal died the majority of the people were pretty satisfied with the show.
Yup, but I think FFN is where all the dany haters ended up
So... we should tune out everyone who's online and well informed? Sure. I'll ask my grandmother.   \n\nAnd also- have you not seen Facebook, twitter and instagram? The amount of hate there surpasses this.
> If Ned Stark's execution happened in this season, it would be described as \"trashy\" and \"lazy writing\".\n\nIf Ilyn Payne jumped off a balcony in King's Landing and stabbed Ned while saying something super edgy because he kinda forgot he had no tongue, yeah.
[deleted]
I would say most (albeit not all) of what happens in the finale is consistent with the show narrative, but somehow it seems this sub is not accepting a *single* thing about the ending. It's all shit.
I don't think it's stranger than any other character this season or the previous one.\n\nI just think it's weird the voters clearly love her but the comment section reflects the opposite
Comment sections are always cancerous.   Look at any comment section anywhere online and its the same.  Hate is a strong emotion and people want to vent.  And the internet allows them a degree of anonymity so they say things that they would never say in person.
That\u2019s not what their comment was about.
This is probably the most show positive sub.
if you really believe that, I recommend subs like r/asoiafcirclejerk and r/DanAndDaveFanclub r/SansaWinsTheThrone (and probably other GoT Character Sub-subreddits). You will see that this sub is still extremely negative.
Well that's just silly.
Agreed. I think every ill with the season can be tied to the decision to the shorten the last two season.
It went from character driven stories to a plot driven narratives.  They took all those ending moments you point out (spinoffs) and then worked backwards to the first episode.
There has to be some fall out for this? If they had finished the show with the quality of the first 6 seasons they would have been gods in the directing/writing world, anyone with a movie or series to shoot would have given anything to have them involved. After how they treated this ending I would be apprehensive to give them any story I had written, what if they half ass the end again? What if they half ass the whole thing?\n\nThere was only 1 chance to do this show given how it started, no one is going to want to re do it as it would be compared to the original 6 season's and it would almost definitely fall short, you cant just re do the end in 10 years as thats stupid. \n\nAt the half way point of this show, with the quality that it was they had guaranteed this was the only chance to tell the story right and they didn't do it. Now it will always be not as good as it could have been, and I dont want them to get away with it.
What interests me is the connection with Star Wars now.  Disney must be in full damage control mode.  People are mad/disappointed in D&D and will likely take it out on Star Wars cause it's the only real action they can take against these two.
There should be but there is no god of justice, only the god of tits and wine.
I have no doubt that some HBO executives are punching themselves in the dick right now. Probably ganging up on the poor bastard who argued for the \"artistic freedom\" to allow D&D to finish the show the way they wanted to.
D&D really shouldn't be allowed to write any more. Imagine them utterly destroying other long-beloved franchises. This is worse than Michael Bay's version of stories.
Here, here! (applause)
D&D don't care.  Disney threw boatloads of cash and 4 star wars movies at them.
Judging by the viewer numbers, I highly doubt it.
uh... maybe not?  at least one higher up was complimenting them.  smh.
Has there been any comments about the ratings from HBO or D&D? Arguably the biggest show in TV just ended and I haven't really seen anything from the people in charge
>the end of episode 3\n\nFTFY
Yeah even though many fans weren\u2019t admitting it at the time the show died with the NK being inexplicably shanked out of nowhere by a character whose plot has had nothing to do with the Army of the Dead.  \n\nCersei and Euron were laughably contrived OP final bosses. What were the stakes once the NK was killed? Nothing, and that was the issue. Why should i care at all about the battle for the iron throne when Dany has been outrageously nerfed since 7.01? Not to mention she defeats the Lannisters in *exactly* the same way she could have done in 7.01. All her defeats in S7, the entire NK plot and battle of Winterfell - Lol yeah none of it mattered, all you need is Drogon to take the city
I agree. This was the episode that really cemented the fact that the show was beyond saving. They basically ruined one of they key plotlines of the entire series in a matter of minutes.
>the Wight Hunt in season 7\n\nFTFY
>all of episode 3
DURING episode 3. \n\nFTFY
>the end of Season 7\n\nFTFY
>the end of episode 3\n> FTFY\n\nThe start of Episode 3 \n\nFTFY
by episode 4 is essentially the same as the end of episode 3
Episode 3 tanked the show. It made all the previous seasons pointless. I was the biggest GoT fan up until episode 3, and then I just resorted to memes and leaks to be able to cope with the disappointment.
*season 5\n\nEdit: I originally put season 6 because at least season 5 had Hardhome, but even that doesn't rule out Dorne
The best episode of s8 is inarguably 2.
inarguably is a very funny word to use when it comes to opinions
Have a real discussion or any kind of real interaction between Dany and Jon, that explained her actions and made us actually think he liked her. \n\nShow the fallout of her death! How are you going to kill the arguably main character of a story and just skip over all of the fallout, show no emotional reactions from any of the characters except her dragon?\n\nHave Jon and Greyworm fight. They built up to it before this, and there's simply no way Greyworm would let Jon live. Or if they're not gonna fight, then *don't* show Greyworm executing prisoners right before this, because those two things don't make sense together. Either he kills prisoners or he doesn't, don't show both in the same episode with no explanation.\n\nDon't make Bran the king, goddamn. So dumb. Either Jon or Gendry are the king, or they just split up all of the kingdoms in this episode. If Jon's not the king, there should be a good political reason, not just \"These guys who are on their way out won't allow it, for the week that they're still on this continent\". Jon should've had a character-defining choice to make in the end, just like Arya did when she gave up her revenge on Cersei, just like Theon did when he died defending Bran. \n\nSansa's political arc should've paid off. Just asking for and being randomly given a kingdom is not Littlefinger-esque scheming; it's no better than the bratty wannabe queen from season 1. This was a complete failure in character development payoff. She should've used her hard-earned wiles to scheme for a better outcome for Jon or the kingdoms.\n\nBronn should be dead, come on. No way he should be lord of Highgarden.\n\nEtc. Etc. There was a lot of stupid stuff in this episode, from the minor to the major, even just off the top of my head.
Jon and Dany did have that interaction and it was more than i could have ever hoped for in one episode to explain her mindset. Not sure why you imply this didnt even happen.\n\nIll agree on the fallout and fight with Grey Worm, but the way they did it was good too because if youre gonna have a time jump it should be after a climactic moment. \n\nMore debate leading to Bran would have been nice but i think he was the perfect choice. \n\nI dont think the point of Sansas arc was to become a schemer, it was to becaome a leader and thats what she did. \n\nBronn was promised Highgarden, Tyrion gave his word. And Bronns point about how houses start was totally right, now this is the follow-through.
I think we all waited for that, and it never happened. And I don\u2019t understand the reasoning behind that. Why introduce story elements like that, just to never use them again?
That sub will make you lose your god damn mind, I swear to god your sanity will be questioned.
Ya I went way too far down the rabbit hole
Apparently, r/gameofthrones, the most favorite of the show are \u201cLawful Evil\u201d to them
That's the best GoT sub among all the madness.
They thought it was so bad that their rating system looped back around and they gave it a 10.
A few thousand people snapped and went mad perhaps?
the first 20mins were ok so its clearly not a 1. the rest was an absolute shit show so it got a solid 3 from me
I didn't even think the first 20 minutes were okay. They were so fucking baffling at every turn.\n\n* Maybe half of it is spent on Tyrion going to find Cersei and Jaime. I get it, he's looking for his siblings. You can still do that, but it didn't need to be literally 5 minutes of walking through streets and corridors, we could have opened the episode with that.\n* Apparently Cersei and Jaime would have been totally fine if they just didn't stand in the one specifically place where bricks fell down.\n* Excited to find out what was with Arya and that horse? Well, it wasn't important, because she just kind of shows up and watches Dany and the horse is nowhere to be seen.\n* Dany is apparently able to speak so loudly that thousands of screaming Dothraki can hear her clearly. I get that she's Dragonborn but she wasn't even shouting, dude.\n* I mostly thought the scene with Tyrion/Jon was okay, but fuck, Jon is REALLY resistant to say anything bad about the girl he dated for literally like *two episodes*, despite her killing what, half a million innocent people?\n* Dany talks like a lunatic and then gets stabbed after about 2 minutes. Cool. Also, Jon holds Dany as she's dying in the *absolute most awkward way possible* (see the picture for Question 4 in this survey). Seriously, it looked so fucking terrible! I haven't seen anybody else mention this but I'm sure people have.\n* Drogon is either apparently able to grasp the complexity of inter-continental politics and power struggles and destroys the throne as a reactionary measure because it is a symbol of power, or maybe he just really fucking hates chairs, who knows.\n* Oh, we time skipped, and apparently Grey Worm just walked Jon out of there for being a bad boy and killing literally the only person left he cares about after already showing himself to be a merciless killer at the start of the episode.\n\nAnd this is just the stuff that I was actually thinking *as I was watching*, there's more to nitpick if you go back and look at it. Honestly, in Episode 5 I mostly watched the episode and then at the end thought \"okay, well, that was pretty damn bad.\" In Episode 6 it was so bad I kept being pulled out of it because I was thinking \"this is just really fucking stupid.\"

So it\u2019s brainless to enjoy something others didn\u2019t now...?
The writing is the core of any show. If the writing isn't any good, nothing else matters. All other things are build upon that foundation.
Would you rate this episode 1/10?
I gave it a 1. In my opinion, no amount of quality acting or amazing production could redeem the horrendous plot and writing. I gave it a 1 because after years of being incredibly invested in this show, the conclusion was so bad that it didn\u2019t feel real.\n\nI got more emotional reading and thinking about theories in the months leading up to S8 than I got during season 8 itself. To me the entire thing just felt like bad fanfiction- too poorly written and illogical to be taken seriously.\n\nI felt nothing when Daenerys went mad. I felt nothing when Jon killed her. I rolled my eyes at Bran and Sansa being king and queen (in the north). I felt a sort of disconnected wtf when Arya killed the NK. Even when Rhaegal died I was mostly like \u201cwtf that makes no sense\u201d.\n\nAnd in many ways that is unfathomable to me. I was so invested in the show, before. Things that would happen could affect my mood all week. I was devastated when Robb died. My stress level and investment in the Mountain vs Oberyn was through the roof. I literally cried in relief when Daenerys escaped the Khals. I was sick to my stomach when Rickon died. \n\nSomehow this season turned me from being that person into someone that feels like \u201cwhatever, this is just frustratingly stupid\u201d for basically every single thing that happens. I think it was because this season really epitomized what has been gradually happening for the past couple seasons- it no longer feels like GoT is a show where actions have consequences. It used to feel so high stakes, like everything was connected to each other- even small actions in Essos would have their effects ripple across to set off chains of events in Westeros. \n\nBut now it just feels like they\u2019re drawing random events out of a hat for the ending. Aaaaand this week we got... drumroll... \u201cRhaegal is going to die, Braime is going to bang, aaaaand 3X dick jokes! Sorry for all those folks who were hoping for Cleganebowl. Tune in next week and remember, the more you tweet @Cleganebowl2019, the more entries it will get in next week\u2019s drawing!\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with me. But that is why, after some thoughtful consideration, I gave it a 1/10. To me, this was basically as bad as \u201cand then aliens invade\u201d. I would have preferred Bran waking up from a dream.
watching the dothraki charge was when my mind just zonked out and the series became a complete joke.  my mind just couldn't handle the utter stupidity of the writing.  watched the rest of the season in a stupor.  writing was utter shit.  so many people don't realize that that the whole battle was the equivalent of a modern army throwing away their guns and charging enemy machine guns with a knife.
So fucking overdramatic my god
The writing is 90% of the show, so a score of \"1\" makes sense.
cinematography = 10.  acting = 10.  music = 10.  directing = 10.  writing = -99.   minimum score 1.  math checks out.
Really?! The acting felt stiff and forced in many places (due to the bad writing). Sure, the visuals and musical score were good... but IMHO, writing is pretty damned important.
This sub really is vicious to the Sansa fans
She's the worst.
It baffles me also
Lol no, a vocal minority are vicious to Sansa fans. The VAST majority of this sub is unreasonably obsessed with her.
The people who read some of the books gave the episode the same rating as those who didn't read the books. It's quite literally in the poll. There's a bit of a discrepancy between these groups and those who have read all five books, but it's fairly normal for more hardcore fans to be less forgiving and way more critical.\n\nI read two of the books before the show was announced. I stopped reading when the show was announced because it's more fun to read a book after having seen the television show than the other way around. When you first read the source material, it's a lot easier to be dissapointed with the television adaptation because you'll have certain expectations. \n\nMeanwhile, when you first watch the adaptation, a lot of content in the books will still be new and fresh because you can't possibly fit all of that into a movie or series. So you'll be more focused on that and less on the comparison.
Yeah, that's an interesting point. I think it's because the last 2 books introduced characters and plotlines that D&D cut out of the show entirely. And now book readers are just realizing that cutting those things crippled the end-story a bit. So people who have read all 5 books are experiencing an extra disappointment that 75% of this sub won't ever know.\n\nEdit:\n> When you first read the source material, it's a lot easier to be dissapointed with the television adaptation because you'll have certain expectations.\n\nThis is spot on. This is why not reading the books is sometimes the better decision.
This is the first time I have ever connected myself to a book series that is incomplete. I have read through multiple times but only after I watched season 1. \n\n...our watch has begun.
And at least you gave them a shot. I am surprised at how many haven\u2019t read the books at all.
the first one, of course.  a friend gave it to me, saying it's the greatest fantasy book ever.  \nI didn't hate it because it was bad.  I thought it was incredible and a well written, realistic, political drama.  It just wasn't anything close to high fantasy, and I love the escape that high fantasy provides and don't mind the tropes.  it was way too gritty and realistic for me.\n\nI resisted watching it for 7 seasons, but that same friend insisted I watch, and I did, and was amazed, and then... well, you know.
Ughh haha it\u2019s hard to say, I would still rate the episode the same because everything was so rushed and undeveloped. But I think my answers to the specific questions regarding the breaking of the wheel and did the series finale change my opinion on the entire show etc differently. Because after being able to make sense of what happened. My opinions regarding the story as a whole changed. Where as right after I watched It I was still trying to figure out how these characters got from where they started the episode to where they where at when they finished It. So in that sense the episode/ season was still kinda shitty. Not everyone deep dives into what happened like us, so there are a lot of people out there that saw the ending and don\u2019t really understand It.
I tried to explain tyrion's trial to a friend that hasn't seen a single episode and I was amused about how stupid it is even if you remove all the complex character and relationships \n\nSoldier wants 2 prisoners executed but for some reason he waits for a trial, comes with prisoner 1 to the trial, no judge is present, prisoner 1 decides who is gonna be the judge for prisoner 2, the judge is literally the most useless person in the room now and decides that prisoner 1 will be excused and will now serve as his assistant and that prisoner 2 will go vacation with his friends and his pet, soldier thinks the punishment is fair and leaves\n\n\nAnd that doesn't even scratch the surface of how non sense this whole scene is
That Lord's council meeting was such a lazy way to end things. They had a prisoner choose the king, and he chose the wrong one.
> I tried to explain tyrion's trial to a friend that hasn't seen a single episode and I was amused about how stupid it is even if you remove all the complex character and relationships\n\nFor a second there I thought you were talking about Tyrion's trial in S4 and was very confused
Like would greyworm care who the new king is?? Why would he let Tyrion speak and choose a king?? Why were they even in the dragon pit to begin with.. to bargain for Jon or choose a king??
Why do you assume it was a trial? I got it as a council of heads of the most powerful houses. Didin't seem like a trial at all.
Howland Reed, the only dude that can verify Jon's heritage, doesn't mention him at all and votes for his weird cousin to be king that he has never met and who also fucked over his daughter. Jesus christ. Aye.
Yeah just this morning I thought \u201cWait why didn\u2019t we get a scene with Yara about Theon?.\u201d As far as we know she isn\u2019t even aware her brother died.
Why did Yara let Arya threaten her like that?
ugh, stop
I was surprised to even see her. Figured they had just forgotten about her. They did, however, forget about who Yara is and the fact that she had already been granted independence.
We don't tend to get that unless it's really pivotal main characters. Didn't really have any reaction to LF dying for example.
Why did Yara say nothing about independence after the North was granted it when that was the reason she allied with daenerys in the first place?
See, these are the issues I really can't get behind. I totally understand people who are saying that the execution these last few episodes felt really rushed. I totally agree. I didn't mind the ending so much as I did how rushed and confusing it all felt.\n\nWhat I don't get are complaints like yours. You are watching a show about dragons. There's already a lot of suspense of disbelief required. So how come it's too difficult to just assume that Yara has been informed about the faith of Theon offscreen? You can poke a lot of holes in nearly any TV show if you require the directors to put all those events on screen.
There honestly isn\u2019t one main character that you can argue their ending made logical and thematic sense. Dany is at close as it gets and that tells you all you need to know about how badly the other characters have been betrayed. I still can\u2019t get over that thread on here with 15k upvotes that was chastising viewers after 8.04 who thought Jaime was going back to Cersei because he loved her rather than to kill her. The denial was incredible...
Theon! Theon had a redemption arc and he completed it, going from trying to/pretending to kill the Stark boys to giving his life protecting Bran when it mattered most (as far as he knew anyway).\n\nArya almost had an arc. She made a choice in e5 to give up her quest for revenge and choose life and, presumably, family. Unfortunately that was not built up to and they also threw it away immediately when she abandoned her family in the next episode.\n\nBran... Who fucking knows.\n\nDany should've been faced with her choice: be merciful, or be the queen. Instead she became the queen and then also murdered tons of people for no reason, and then never explained it and then got shanked. They had all the necessary elements there for her complete arc and completely discarded them because they're incompetent.\n\nJon needed to have a choice between duty and love. When he killed Dany, that didn't really come off as a real choice, because she was a genocidal maniac and he didn't seem to actually like her very much anyway. And then he never had a choice to be king or not after that anyway, his choices were just made for him. His personality was irrelevant to how his story ended.
I was okay with the hound's ending
Oh my god yes. I was in the Jaime is legit returning because he can't shake his addiction camp. I spent that whole week just lurking and refusing to engage with people who thought I was dumb as rocks for thinking that. I stand by my original quote:\n\n> I get that most people are reading it this way, but it seriously felt like a setback in his character arc watching how it played out last night. Hopefully it turns out better than it felt out of the gate.
I\u2019d say Theon has a pretty good ending from a character development point of view.\n\nAfter all the shit he\u2019s done (attacking Winterfell, \u201ckilling\u201d Bran and Rickon), all the shit he\u2019s had to suffer (Ramsay and Euron), I really enjoyed that his final scenes involved defending the same Stark he supposedly killed.\n\nHim randomly charging the Night King with a spear was pretty dumb, but aside from that I was completely on board with his ending.
Haha for me it is the opposite
The more I think about the trial scene the worse it becomes
I had that problem with episode 3. I just rather not think too much. Even when i was watching it. Just annoyed me so much.
If this was an anime, Arya would be the MC
Yup, very true. The crazy things she does in the show wouldn\u2019t change though because they\u2019re already very Anime-y
The Battle of Winterfell was straight outta DBZ. Jon Snow (Vegeta) is built up to defeat the main bad only for Arya (Goku) to swoop in and save the day.
[This parody comic got it right. This is my favorite fanart of GoT ever.](https://i.redd.it/lzjpbuowgzfz.jpg)
Agreed, I love book Arya, but I've **hated** TV Arya with pure loathing ever since she survived the fight against the waif. That was when she took a turn into a generic TV hero who always survives everything and away from realistic GRRM character.\n\nI mean seriously, the crap she pulled over the last 4 seasons is just insanely wrong, including:\n\n* Survived nearly being killed by the waif because it just so happens some random woman can heal deep sword wounds with just a night's rest and let Arya run around like normal the very next day. Even with today's medical technology it would take over a month for you to fully recover from such an injury, and you **definitely** would not be ready to run for your life and fight to the death the very next day.\n\n* Murdering multiple important members of house Frey and cooking them in a pie without **anyone** noticing something was amiss and sounding an alarm.\n\n* Murdering the Lord of house Frey without anyone noticing.\n\n* Murdering the entirety of House Frey and escaping without a single scratch.\n\n* Jumping in out of nowhere (as if from an Arya catapult) to land on and kill the Night King just in the nick of time, despite being far from the Night King a few minutes prior!\n\n* Cheating death at least a half dozen times as the city was being burnt down and destroyed, including surviving a fire blast from Drogon where they cut away from her a second before she clearly was going to be roasted alive.\n\nThis isn't a GRRM character, this is a TV super hero who can always beat hoards of bad guys no matter how long the odds. It's not what Game of Thrones is about.
I loved Arya's character for the first 4 seasons, my favorite along with Tyrion, and even for most of seasons 5-6.\n\nAfter that, she became some superhero ninja vigilante.  They would show good scenes where she shows signs of her humanity, which I liked, but then they would have her go back to smug robotic ninja again.
Agree 100%. The took the 'badass kid' trope and pushed it so far that she became not just uninteresting but unlikable. Plus the stupid smug look she had on her face for 99% didn't help.
>Even with today\u2019s medical technology it would take over a month for you to recover from such an injury\n\nEven with today\u2019s medical technology those wounds would very likely have been fatal. The Waif literally turned Arya\u2019s intestines into fettuccine bolognese. She could\u2019ve bled out in minutes if a large artery such as the common iliac or inferior mesenteric were lacerated. And between the feces seeping from her bowel perforations and the rank harbor water, Arya had a one way ticket to fulminant peritonitis and septic shock. She would\u2019ve needed emergency surgery (repair any lacerated blood vessels, bowel resection, and washout), big gun IV antibiotics, and a blood transfusion to make it.\n\nEDIT: Grammar
Should have been that Arya got killed by the waif and the waif took her face.
You forgot the worst which is her personality, it has become smug and arrogant treating murder like children's play.
The healing thing was dumb I will give you that...  \n\n\nBut the rest makes sense in her character.  She was meant to be an assasain so quiet and sneaky, even her blood drops are louder than her footsteps.  She escaped without a scratch because simply, she killed the entire house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the catapult, she presumably jumped from a top the wall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso she was not shown for like a half hour before she showed up then.  Jon was fighting the dragon in the courtyard right next to where Bran was.  It makes sense she showed up.  After she talked to the Red Woman, she started to travel over to Bran in order to save him.  The timing was convenient yes, but everyone was fixated on the night king at the time.  Nobody heard her coming and she was incredibly sneaky.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever she did have plot armor from the unbelievable amount of injuries she sustained during her fights.
I surprised that these gaps in logic - purely the fault of the writers - can make you hate the character. Her personality traits still developed in a really interesting and compelling way and that's the core of it. (If you disagree then fair enough, but that's a much better reason than \"she has too much plot armour\".)
Arya is one of those characters that was written to be loved in the very beginning and that has basically been carried all these years and even after she became fucking weird. Book Arya is still alright, but show Arya is the single worst character on this show.
Her character has been terribly written since S6 at least and then it got worse once she returned to Westeros and became this edgy obnoxious & ridiculously OP killer with a constant smug face
I'm not really shocked. And the question was choose your favourite Stark, not necessarily the best character in the whole series. Even though her character became very one-note and strange after season 4, the thing is the other 3 living Starks are not really doing much to overtake her as favourite Stark. And she really benefitted from killing the Night King this season.\n\nBran was never going to have a lot of fans. I'm very surprised Jon was not everyone's favourite Stark, but this season was not very good for him. People mostly love what his character represents: a bastard who's actually a prince, the person who was willing to bring everyone together. But personality-wise, sometimes he's lacking in that area because of his quiet and brooding nature, but people remember the spunky rebellious Arya.\n\nSansa is interesting because her fans have really increased over the last 4 seasons, but unfortunately her character was one of the most hated in the beginning. And the people who tend to love Arya won't easily interchange her with Sansa. It also didn't help that this season she was being compared to Littlefinger and Cersei.
So.. what are the problems with her? Besides surviving stuff she shouldn\u2019t survive, what are the problems with how she acts?
To me, her motivations are completely inconsistent. She gives up her assassin training because being a Stark is too important to her, good. She gives up her trip south to kill Cersei when she hears that the Starks took back Winterfell, good. She tells Jon how family is important yada yada. But then after the NK dies, she immediately bails on her family again on what she says is a one-way trip to kill Cersei. Wtf? Didn't we already get over this? Why did she regress by two seasons suddenly with no explanation?\n\nIt's even crazier because she has the power to end the war single-handedly, and just doesn't tell anyone. Like Sansa in the BoB, she lets Jon  lead a battle to his probable death when she knows she could prevent it, if she just told him ahead of time. This makes absolutely no sense as a character decision.\n\nThen she decides not to kill Cersei and to live instead, which is good in theory, except I no longer even know what her deal is or what's driving her decisions. Presumably she wants to survive and be with her family? But then after Bran becomes king, she bails on her family again! What the hell, Arya? What are you even doing? What does this character value, what does she want? She harps on about family but clearly doesn't give a shit about them. She comes off as hypocritical and basically crazy.
she's perfectly normal and well adjusted.  she should be a traumatized, ptsd ridden mess, a sadistic mass murderer hell bent on revenge with little humanity left.
I liked Arya a lot up until Season 5. She *was* my favorite character. But then they 1) shipped her off to Braavos for almost 2 seasons and separated her from every other character, 2) had her survive getting stabbed in the belly and getting sewage poo in her tummy because why not, 3) had her come back to Westeros, murder people and cook them into a pie totally casually, 4) had her kill the Freys and escape with absolutely no consequences and no effect on the narrative whatsoever, 5) had her kill the Night King because they needed it to happen I guess and there wasn't enough time to make it satisfying in any way or involve characters who actually had any storyline connected to him in any way, 6) made her mostly useless in Seasons 7/8 except for the Night King bit and 7) most importantly *sent her off to Braavos in the first place despite none of that really ever paying off.*\n\nI always told myself Arya had invincible plot armor because they sent her to Braavos and there was no way they would do that without bringing her back to make use of what she learned and have an impact on the main story (even her death in Braavos wouldn't affect anybody because most people didn't know she was there or that she was even still alive).\n\nWell, it turns out that was only half right - she did have plot armor, but they didn't seem to have any plans for her at all.\n\nAdmittedly Arya did some despicable stuff before Season 5 too but it was always interesting. For example, when she kills that stable boy in Season 1.
I had loved her character when the show began but started hating it afterwards (season 5 onwards).
Yeah that\u2019s easily the worst scene in GoT history only challenged by the Jaime/Bronn Dorne scenes. The difference is those scenes were forgettable and relatively unimportant. This scene is arguably the MOST important in the show and it\u2019s ALSO so poorly done
Why did the Unsullied let Jon and Tyrion live so long after Dany dies? It's been weeks and they were killing no-name Lannister soldiers for fun earlier. The guy who betrayed their queen and the guy who killed her get to live? Then they allow Tyrion to decide the king and Jon to go into exile, then up and leave. Additionally, the Dothraki seemingly merge with Westeros and live in King's Landing now (They weren't leaving on those ships) when they should be killing Jon then committing suicide as blood riders do.\n\nThe king decision scene was a huge load of BS. Arya threatens Yara with no effect, Sansa insults her uncle (an ally) for no reason which potentially cripple future relations and alliances, Tyrion picks Bran of all people because \"stories are important\" even though he seemingly doesn't mean all the stories Bran can tell but the story of Bran himself (which is a boring story at best), Bran basically announces he knew he'd be King which begs the question 'Did he allow this genocide and fallout?\", and then everyone unanimously agrees this creep they never met should be king based on the words of a traitor.\n\nPlus all the comedy they threw in in the moments after one of the most influential characters died. Plus the terrible small council scene that actually made no sense. How was Tyrion excluded from the history book? He was hand to 2 leaders, killed a hand, and is blamed for killing a king. Sam shouldn't be Grand Maester since he only got 1 or 2 links and didn't spend the years and years necessary at the citadel, it would make more sense for Brienne to be Sansa's Queensguard, and like you said Bronn being Master of Coin makes no sense. Tyrion should have had Bronn executed.\n\nI could probably go on but it's pointless, the shitshow is done and I'm exhausted.
To add on to what the other poster replied with...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJon's heritage wasn't even brought up in the final episode. Ultimately it just became a plot device for Daenerys even though it's a revelation that has world-changing consequences. Varys was even writing letters in Episode 5 and we only saw him burning the last letter he was writing... so unless we're going to fill in the plot whole for the writers the viewer is left to believe the rest of the letters were sent out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am overall pretty disappointed that Jon never got any conflict or development over his true parentage outside of his relationship with Daenerys, but at least that isn't a gaping plot hole like it's complete irrelevance in 8.06.
Watch pretty much ANY review of the episode on YouTube for the answer to your question.
Arya has done some seriously fucked up shit.  \n  \nMurdered a child whose only crime was pushing her \n  \nThreatened and showed off about murdering that child to another child  \n  \nViolently tortured and murdered many, many people  \n  \nMurdered and then hacked up the dead bodies of 2 men to then bake into a pie Hannibal Lector-style to serve to their father    \n  \nSlit the throats of prominent political figures  \n  \nMass poisoned an entire house\n  \nAnd worst of all, killed the saviour of the world, the one true king that could actually bring real peace to the land: the Night King. And in so doing, literally genocided an entire race from the world.  \n  \nArya makes Dany look like a Saint.  \n  \nAnd that little shit got to make a little judgey face about \"I know a killer when I see one\" and got to go Captain Jack Sparrow into the west...  \n  \nI hope a Kraken eats her
All of what you mentioned except for the genocide of the dead, are why I hated how people keep saying look at Dany's past and you can see she was gonna be the mad queen. Most of the characters in this show have done and threatened to do some fucked up shit
I fucking hate Arya stans
It would work better if her story is presented as a tragedy like it is in the books.
Casually threatens Yara to cut her throat too. This little shit got no respect since she has become the most overpowered character in the show.
I know that she was brutal and messed up, but she was also complex and compelling and that's why I loved the character. I never judge TV characters on how much I want to be their friend.
What child did she murder?
As opposed to the super-psychic  who has zero interest in ruling, knows nothing about leading anyone or running a kingdom, has zero social skills, and is so troubled he murdered an entire city and spent 2 seasons so emotionally crippled that he is unable to want at all.
Well I never said I like show Bran being on the throne either.
Honestly that is what I have hated lately.  Even the last 3, 4 seasons.  It is really cool to watch, but that isn't why I loved this show.  I remember back in season 1-4 they didnt even show the fight scenes.  They would just skip through and show the aftermath of it all with a few dead people on the ground.  Aside from a few 1 on 1 battles (Or something of the sorts) they did not show any fighting at all.    \n\n\nIt has turned into too much of a fighting/battle tv show and strayed from their roots of simply good character arcs, conflicts, politics and drama.
>fighting/battle tv show\n\nWhat the fuck fighting did you see? There was only Cleganebowl. It turned into more of a dumb shit happens and Tyrion says dumb shit type of TV show. If it was all battles it would've been much better.
That's pretty much my dad, never even watched season 1 and just watched the show because its popular. Unfortunately that's who it seems these last 2 seasons were catered too.
Who watches a show like this without starting from the beginning? Gross.
I don't think that's a fair summary in this case. A lot of the rage actually comes from these very people, many of whom were Dany stans who fully expected her to sit on the Throne and bring peace and prosperty to the galaxy, and issues of pacing aside could never imagine her doing anything bad.
The gatekeeping in this thread is fucking insipid hahaha
Book reader here, I'd rate the season a 9/10. Character arcs make sense to me, spectacle was amazing. Could've done with a couple more episodes but that doesn't make what was there less than a 9 IMO.
I really don't understand this. Only episode 5 was full of any spectacle at all. What are casual fans enjoying about this at all? Probably more than half the season is just Tyrion talking random nonsense that is supposed to sound smart. I feel like they did a fucking poor job of appealing to casual fans too, but they still liked it for some reason. They walked the line of like trying to be a smart well written show and being a casual fanservicey action packed romp and it woulda been better to just go full on in that direction instead of pretending to be something else.
Episode 3 had spectacle.
I don't even agree that the spectacle was great this season. Battle in episode 3 was too chaoti c. And dark to even see what was going on. The NK's death was about as lame as could be. I had no idea what was happening with the dragon fight in that episode. The epic fights this season were anything but epic. Compare cleganebowl to the hound vs. Brienne fight. The sacking of Kings Landing was basically just Dany flying around burning things. Compare that to the scene when she takes out the ships at slavers bay. Even the spectacle fell short this episode, partly, I think, because emotional investment in the characters was severely lacking this season after they decided to completely 180 everyone.
I really apreciate it now even more, that I have really loved the finale, after reading all that stupid butthurt comments.\n  I am not your opinion. So what?\n  Guess what, I found it genius! \n   I'm happy and satisfied, and I dont know, but I prefer to be NOT your opinion.
Yup, I think I forget that not everyone is like me (surprising I know)\n\nI hate TV. Haven\u2019t watch a single series of TV in years before GoT, but this show was different. And that\u2019s what I loved.\n\nA huge portion of the fan base watches all the random garbage on TNT and CBS and FX and whatever so GoT is just another night they have plunked in front of the tube.\n\nAnd for those people it was great. Another piece of eye candy they could use to waste the time between work and sleep. All my friends on Facebook who liked the final season fit that description to a tee.
Whatever random CBS TNT FX shows you are thinking are simply better than this season, that's the crazy part. People will still say this season was better because it had well designed dragons and costumes and shit, but a fucking Big Bang Theory episode is way more logically and tonally consistent than this season.
Nope, I listen to a radio show daily that\u2019s decided they were going to talk about GoT while it was on. And they did a TERRIBLE job. Not knowing literally anyone\u2019s names except for Jon and \u201cDany\u201d\n\nAnd they were upset at all the people who didn\u2019t like the finale. They couldn\u2019t even mention Arya by name, just that she was the little assassin girl. Yet they thought the fandom was over reacting
Some people still seem to think Daenerys' name is Khaleesi.
i overheard someone on the bus say that people only dislike it because the show is ending and it made the most sense that 'wheelchair kid' would be leader. They also said dany was 100% alive and warged into her dragon
Ok but hang on that sounds really cool
Maybe a lot of them, but a guy on a forum I visit has been watching since S1 aired, and has read all the books, and he loved season 8. I'm baffled by it too, to be honest, but there we go. There are legitimate fans who weren't disappointed and we probably shouldn't be snobby and dismissive of everyone.
\"if you liked the show you're a casual\"\n\nimagine being this insufferable
They really are casual thou. Not that there's anything wrong with liking things casually but don't complain when people have valid criticism. Like how can anyone be okay with the ironborn and Dorneish just accepting a new king while the north goes free? The same ironborn who rebelled just 7 years ago for their own independence is now blindly loyal to a dead queen who they only fought for because she promised them independence aren't seizing this chance to be free? Or the Dorneish who have defyed Targaryen rule for 200 years just go along with a new king? Stuff like this is happening constantly on the show these past seasons and I can't see how anyone truely immersed in the story wouldn't be tired of having to constantly ignore what the characters were saying to enjoy the show, especially when this show was initially built off the wonderful characters and not constant Micheal bay action scenes.
/r/gatekeeping ?
If the only requirement to get through that gate is naming 5 main characters, after 8 seasons, that's a gate im willing to keep till I die
There's definitely a certain group this season aimed to please, and dismissing those people as \"not true fans\" is stupid. Let people enjoy things.
No one is stopping anyone from enjoying anything.
No. I read all the books twice, watched the series 3 times, and as flawed as season 8 was, I still loved it. I still do, despite what's happening in this thread.\n\nI've been kind of depressed all week though, had some deaths in the family and coming on here compounds that. My GF and I both really liked a lot of the season, the knighting of Brienne, Dany turning into her father, Jon ultimately deciding to abandon his honor, his title, and love for what's right, Drogon destroying the throne. Tyrion throwing out the family monarchy in favor of a voting system was a great step towards democracy and what I always imagined Tyrion's character would offer the world. The coming together of all characters to fight a common battle, drinking together post-battle. Fitting, sad deaths of Theon, Jorah, Edd. The cinematography and music were beautiful, the acting fantastic. There were writing issues that have been talked about ad naseum here, but it wasn't enough to bring down the culmination of it all for me.\n\nSo yes, it's true, I loved it despite its flaws. No, it's not the best in the series. But it ended it well for me and I was massively entertained.\n\nBut like I said, people claiming that if I liked it I \"can't name more than five characters\"... this is just too much for me guys. I might have to stop reading here.
Idk, I could name every main character and 90-95% of every named character, and I thought the ending was alright.  I wouldn't say it's amazing, but the people who are calling it shit seem like the people who would have been mad at every single ending unless it was the one ending they wanted to happen.  And the people who are calling it disappointing probably held D&D to GRRM's standards, which was never going to happen.  Not even GRRM can finish his own books to his standards in ten years, and they expected D&D to do it in two?  There were things I wish were fleshed out more, but for the most part, I thought the end was explained well enough that I could fill in gaps/missing scenes and conversations.  And logically, the plot made sense and was built up well enough for me to accept.  I don't know why people are complaining that Dany going mad came out of nowhere.  She's been this way since the beginning and has always had advisors caution her, and push for mercy.  Without them, no one's there to advise mercy, and we get King's Landing.  On the death of the NK, I'm fine with Arya killing him too.  Yeah, it would have made complete sense for Jon to do it, but I know that if he did, people would have complained that it followed the fantasy trope.  Too many differenct fans, someone will always complain.  People just held season 8 to a higher standard and forgot about the shortcomings in prior episodes.  They've hyped the ending in their own heads for two years, so when they didn't get what they want, they complain on the internet.
Wat. \n\nYou think the rightful heir to the throne who killed a person who just torched an entire city of innocents should be sent to a wall for life to protect the kingdom from the guys they destroyed in episode 3? Meanwhile, they let a little guy who is on trial for treason basically make the most important decision the Kingdom will make for centuries? And then they pick a guy who hasn\u2019t said a fucking thing for a couple seasons. That same guy got a bunch of \u201caye\u2019s\u201d from house leaders who wouldn\u2019t even know who bran was, or much less why he\u2019s fit to be king. Bran says earlier that he can never be lord of anything, but now he\u2019s king. He also says he\u2019s come all this way to be king, so basically he knew Dany was going to killed a few hundred thousand innocents and just let it happen. \n\nYou\u2019re totally cool with Bran gaining all these powers and then just ghosting for the battle with the dead? And you\u2019re also fine with the White Walkers targeting Bran for some unknown reason even though he clearly doesn\u2019t do anything? You\u2019re cool with the White Walkers obviously having some intelligence and motive, but then their story is over before we even understand anything about them? Why were they targeting encyclopedia instead of the A10 Warthogs? \n\nYou\u2019re cool with Arya getting some crazy powers in order to make pies out of tertiary characters and then never use them again? \n\nThere\u2019s easily another season worth of story to wrap up/explain. You could easily make two seasons without it feel like it\u2019s dragging on.
They got weird ass names. I\u2019ve watched the show since the start and am doing my second re-watch and I still don\u2019t know half the characters names. (I\u2019m not one that thought the last two seasons were any good though) \n\u201cYo that\u2019s that bad dude that fucks with magic and green shit!\u201d \u201cYo that\u2019s that dude that sounds like he\u2019s coughing up phlegm when he says his name\u201d. \u201cYo, \u201ccool uncle\u201d shitty jack Sparrow is on!\u201d That\u2019s how I remember the characters.
Casual
You selfrighteos fucks\n\n   Jesus.
That is pretty much me. I don't look too hard at shows and just like it based on how it made me feel. I thought for the most part season 8 was really good, but even I had problems with the last episode.
Except if you don\u2019t care about those 2 things then what do you care about? Action? Because this episode had none. Characters? Because none of them made sense.\n\nThe only people who I could see genuinely enjoying that episode are fans of Bran or people who only watch the series because it\u2019s \u201ctrendy\u201d but have never actually seen an episode before season 6. And I doubt that makes up 10% of this subreddit.\n\nNo, I\u2019m almost completely positive the \u201cAmazing (9.9)\u201d people were only trying to skew the ratings system because they new that so many people were going to crush this episode.
Some people don\u2019t nitpick. As a book reader before the TV series was announced I understand that there are some holes and that not everyone is happy, but I\u2019m sure that I\u2019m not the only one who thought, \u201cwow that was really incredible to have been a part of all this and goddamn what an ending\u201d
They are.\n\nDoesn't mean I can't scratch my head, questioning as to how they came to that opinion.
If I said Scary Movie 5 was the greatest film ever made I\u2019d hope someone would show up and question my opinion. \n\nJust because something is subjective doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be head scratching
[deleted]
Doesn't mean some opinions aren't wrong.
Yeah, but is that reaction really that bad?\n\nIt'd be like 'oh whoa, you support the pro-life bill?' type of realization.
Comparing liking an episode of a TV show to supporting a bill that requires children to bear their rapist's babies. This is some peak /r/gameofthrones shit.
There's no way edmure joins sansa after that
There's a reason he sat down, and that's because he's already subservient to her. If he had to choose between joining his boss-niece Sansa or the people who kept him captive all this time, the Lannisters, of course he'd choose Sansa. Her being rude once is not enough to convince a kingdom to abandon their allies and join their enemies.
LOL it\u2019s a rolling commode!
I\u2019m sure he attempts to jerk off at times. Who knows it\u2019s just hard to take Bran serious
I guess I was in completely different sub full of fanart and cosplay like the off-season and \"unpopular opinion: I liked it\" x100 silver, x1000 gold, x10000 plat. \nAll the fun community left this sub a long time ago.
Have you been in a single episode thread? Post-episode thread? Survey thread? Any of the dozens of \u201cthis made no sense and here\u2019s why\u201d threads? \n\nSure this sub isn\u2019t as critical as r/asoiaf and turned on the writers later but this sub has been complaining non-stop since Episode 4 at least.
bruh what? this sub has been nothing but whinging and the few posts that do say \"I liked it\" get immediately shit on in the comments
This sub isn't r/asoiaf (which really all it does is complain) but it certainly has a lot of defenders. Until 8.06 the last few episodes have had at least two threads simply stating how they like the episode and it becomes a well-liked gilded thread (including one that asked for no negativity and just positive comments):\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bnxnib/spoilers\\_unpopular\\_opinion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bnxnib/spoilers_unpopular_opinion/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is one of the more recent ones I can easily find (I am not investing time to hunt down the rest). I've even seen genuine complaints get constantly written off as haters, people who aren't paying attention, people who should not watch the show anymore, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis sub certainly has gotten negative, but it's not as if there aren't a lot of positive posts either. If it was positive in past seasons and turned negative in this most recent one that is very telling of season 8.
Now *there's* a show that knows how to end right. They're so good at series finales, they made three!
Agreed. I\u2019m ok with all of the major plot points of season 8, just not the execution.
100% agree. I\u2019m just so happy for them they made it
Even as a Sansa fan I found literally all of the rest of it unsatisfying
If anything, it should be worse. My wife and I started the show 4 weeks ago with no spoilers. We clearly saw pacing and writing inconsistencies starting at around the end of season 6 whenever Arya gets stabbed like 4 times and survives and heals in a night. From then on, plot armor and shitty pacing was very obvious since the previous seasons were literally only days apart to us watching.
Yep. This isn't just book readers nitpicking about their favorite theories not coming to fruition. It was a fundamental failure of storytelling. My mother, my sister, and the guys at the barber shop I go to are all show-only people, and they were all bitterly disappointed, and could clearly articulate the problems with the past two seasons' narratives, character issues, and logic.
watching the dorne plot was very jarring.  everything was just completely off.  characters were no longer coherent, and the plot was just...
> My wife and I started the show 4 weeks ago with no spoilers. \n\nMajor props to your epic binge.
I'm a big stan of Sansa and still found this season disappointing, and episode 6 was extremely underwhelming and frustrating for me.
I just lowered my expectations after season 6 and a bit more after season 7. So it was difficult to be disappointed. Also a bit of a Sansa fan.
The show has been up and down for a few seasons now in my opinion. I liked some episodes this season and disliked some others. I thought that the ending felt rushed and a bit confusing, but at the same time I also don't think that any possible ending would have been good enough for me. So I'm a bit forgiving.\n\nAlso, I loved the Long Night. I'm probably a minority in that.
That sub is where you go when you want to ignore the problems this season had, those people legit think this season was absolutely amazing and there is no constructive discussions where they point out issues and if you attempt to voice your opinion that the writing is bad - they say you are just a sheep. Ironically, they have a sheep mentality that this season was actually good - stray to far from the herd and you get hated on.
I've seen the most meaningful discussions (and criticisms) of S8 so far down in the comments on that sub. Unlike others which are just a hate wagon.
I'm not really making any conclusions. I just think it is interesting. I personally saw some leaks by accident and I think it affected the experience. The leaks I saw out of context were really dumb, and when it actually happened it was a bit frustrating.
Yea I meant to reply to the guy that replied to you. Sorry.
> the things the Hound told her before he fought the Mountain were exactly what most people were thinking\n\nBut did those even make sense? He was trying to tell her that she has to be careful and shouldn't let vengeance consume her, but she already murdered a family and baked them into pies to feed to their father out of revenge. \n\nLike, vengeance already has her, and for one person saying \"nah but what if you didnt?\" to just change her entire life made no sense.
I liked the opening sequence and the credits after D&Ds name went away
When the best parts of Game of Thrones are the ones without dialogue, something went wrong
> I disagree with the concept that a popular character should prevail at the end of the story. It's exactly the opposite of what GRRM's story is based upon.\n\nCharacters are usually popular because they are interesting though. What has happened here is a boring character which the audience is not particularly invested in has been put on the throne instead of one anyone enjoys watching. An interesting character getting the throne would have been much better, whether that is a character who is good or bad or likely or unlikely to sit the throne.
You are using different words to say the same thing: you'd much rather have someone that the public loves be the final winner.\n\nThis is not how the story works, it has been established since Season 1 and it's one of the main reasons it's such a good story
Bronn's whole story this season was such a giant mess.
Yeah I think they absolutely wasted him
are you Dan or Dan? You just keep defending this pile of horseshit all over the place...
I didn't like many things about this season. This doesn't mean the story is a pile of horseshit.
Yeah, I get people having issues with the execution of the finale. I agree with that. It felt really rushed and they should probably have done another season if they wanted to wrap things up the way they did. This show used to be slow paced and intriguing, not an action novel.\n\nSo I get that complaint. What I don't get is how a lot of complaints boil down to \"things didn't go the way I wanted to\", which sort of has been the trademark of the show from the start. I have to admit that I do think that Bran isn't the most interesting character, but I also think that he mostly just suffered from the rushed execution and the fact that his story arc has been a bit of an irrelevant mess until the last few episodes.\n\nThey tried to make him a bit more interesting and relevant these last few episodes, but it was wasted effort because he simply had been so irrelevant to the main storyline for so long and a few episodes of screentime isn't going to change that. So again, the story really could have worked well if they would have taken their time with it.
Sure that played a part, but if you deny that Tyrion saying those words him were very helpful in convincing Jon, then you weren't paying attention. And regardless, it was still a great callback to S1.
It really went from bad to worse didn't it.\n\nSeason 7 writing \n\n1. Stupid idea to go on wight hunt and lose a dragon to the night king\n2. Loads of pregnancy related breadcrumbs for all of them to be entirely pointless at the end\n3. Littlefinger plot and the whole fake Arya and Sansa bickerings\n4. Bran returned only to become a zombie tree man with no sharing of any of the information - what good was it for him to have all that free internet bandwidth with no use to anyone. It is still literally unbelievable that NK came only for Bran\n\nSeason 8 - well there are probably 10-12 things wrong which I am not going to list and all of them are worse than the season 7 ones
The Arya and Sansa bickerings weren't fake.
Yeah, which is why I'm okay with it. I think that whatever ending the show would have had, it wouldn't have been satisfying. Except maybe an open ending. I can't think of any big show ending that was celebrated, except for Breaking Bad.\n\nIt's a bit dissappointing that they rushed it so bad that it became confusing. I think that to wrap it up like they did, they had to spend way more time developing the story arcs rather than changing characters seemingly at will. Still, it's been one of the best shows I've ever watched and a lesser ending isn't going to change that.
They are not trolling. The ppl that gave this episode a 10, just gave every other episode a 10. Consistency and some questionable intelligence.
So, they turned the wheel on its side? Now instead of a wheel that crushes the peasants under its rim as great houses fight to be on top, now it is a merry-go-round that is driven by political machinations? A pretty courtly political dance far above the heads of the common folk?\n\nBecause I could buy that if they didn't skip over all the political dealings and ramifications.
It\u2019s an improvement from before, Rome wasn\u2019t built in one day. If they installed a democracy I would have shut off the tv before the episode ended. This takes place in medieval times. Democracy didn\u2019t come about until hundred of years later.. it\u2019s a process
They still do. \n\nA Stark is in charge with a Lannister and a Tarly serving on his council. The Greyjoys, Martell, Arryn and Baratheon families are all still in charge of their respective territory. On top of that, the Stark family is also in charge of their own independent kingdom. \n\nAll of these families will give their titles down through their families and no other way. Exception of this is the actual throne since Bran can't have an heir, so yeah, bloodshed awaiting.\n\nDon't give me the whole \"they did it for the realm\", Sam proposed an elective monarchy and it became clear that they laughed at the idea of letting go of their positions of power. They propped up one of theirs (member of a rich and powerful family) to assure the benefit of their own interests.
A big bad an episode, till no one is left but Tormund and Ghost, because they could never be big bads.
He was amazing in bodyguard

Thank you for this comment, really brought up my mood.
Damn Arya ruined pies for me, now thats the first thing I think about whenever someone mentions pies.
also possibly true, agreed
Maybe I sounded that way which was not my intention. I just wanted to point out that 1 is too unfair. Anyways, I agree with your main argument I should not generalize or try to guess people's reasoning. I am a bit sad about all the people involved and their effort.
if you got an average person and made them use more than about 40% of their attention to watch this series all the way through, you have to be borderline challenged to rate it a 7 or above. either that or you are a delusional peter pan child who thinks everything is wonderful and negativity is bad.
\"So Dorne and The Iron Islands don't want to secede despite Dorne being really high-up in authority, and Yara literally only joining Daenerys under the concession of independence?\"\n\n\"Huh, Arya killing Green Eyes didn't pan out huh?\" \n\n\"Bran Stark, the guy who didn't want to be Lord of Winterfell, hasn't had his powers explained and hasn't warged into anything or done anything of importance is now King and done nothing to earn it outside of being 'magical bait', which isn't even all his doing (NK marked him)? The guy who literally got carried everywhere cause of his bum legs?'\n\n\"Why does Tyrion get to talk and tell them choose a leader if he's a prisoner?\"\n\n\"So Jon's Targaryen ancestry boils down to riding Rhaegal in one battle, and fucking up his relationship with Daenerys? Not even a contender for the throne with no one battling to save him? Like he was stripped of his titles. He didn't even come up for nomination.\"\n\n\"Why did Drogon burn the throne and carry of Daenerys body?\"\n\n\"How did Bronn become Lord of Highgarden. How does a common cut-throat become leader over countless other houses when he doesn't know how to read or write.\"\n\n\"Why is there a Night's Watch, or was that a farce. Are Yara and Dorne angry and going to upkeep a watch on Jon, or is he literally okay if Greyworm fucks off? What is this.\"\n\n\"Greyworm, you're going to the place with flesh-eatting butterflies.\"\n\n\"So expanding on this; Tyrion basically fucks up everything for Daenerys, and then gets her killed and is now Hand of the King again? What a punishment. /s.  This is the guy who after realizing Varys was right commented how Varys was going to tell him 'I told you so', over 'Wow I killed my best friend over nothing.' How did Tyrion become fucking judge, jury, and executioner at his own trial.\"\n\n\"So I get the whole system change, which will still probably lead to fighting cause system changes do that, but Daenerys infertility was an issue, and Bran's is a virtue. Kinda an odd feeling juxtaposition. Nitpick here though.\"\n\n\"Arya trained with faceless assassins and only used her magical face skills ONE TIME in Westeros.  Not to kill Cersei, not against the Night King, not against Daenerys, not against Sansa or Littlefinger. Against Walder Frey and his house. Wow.\"\n\n\"Writing is a magical thing that can make anything work and be powerful. But tell me, do people believe in Jon and Daenery's romance?  Now let's say Jon tried to kill Daenerys but got detained by guards that Daenerys is missing in her scene for some reason. What if Jorah Mormont had lived and Daenerys had gone crazy? How would it have felt if Jorah had killed her instead? Died to dragonfire after?  That would've been fucking heartbreaking. And it would've totally killed the dumb [lover must kill lover] trope. Could even have Jon drop Longclaw. Jon and Daenery didn't have chemistry or the time to make it happen. Jorah and Daenerys did, eight seasons worth.\"
> you have to be borderline challenged to rate it a 7 or above\n\nBro, you had a chance to clarify it was an exaggeration, yet here you are doubling down and literally calling people borderline mentally challenged for liking this season.\n\nI'm going to assume there's not a single show or film that you like or think is good, otherwise I get to call you mentally challenged. See how this works?
mate it has 4 upvotes and every single reply is hating on it.
got technically worse by number... see any score for rt, imdb..lol
I mean he disappeared off into the wilderness where he will definitely be chopping trees down at some point. Too close to being a lumberjack for comfort.
Well, you feed people to dogs for fun so I don't know if I trust your opinion.
At least we dont practice incest
Right, but Dany's followers might have been cool with it if they found out Jon's true identity??? Guess we will never know...
you want a pat on the back for hating it? seems like most people on the sub do.
[deleted]
If you hated It so much why are you wasting your time discussing It on the internet with strangers. You didn\u2019t hate It, It just didn\u2019t meet the same standard of quality as seasons 1-5. \n\nI think everyone is confusing hate for the last season with disappointment.
It's true even if they downvote
Better than expected? Yes\n\nGood? Definitely not
Yeah i've been defending this show all season but the finale was indefensible imo i think they tried to curveball everyone but went too far
I do kinda see his point, and I've never even tried cocaine.
So you're saying more people really liked it than hated it? ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)
Ok but that is cherry picking to fit your narrative. Why did you not choose 1-2 and 9-10? Because it doesn't fit your narrative.
I ran the descriptive statistics on the data set and the distribution is negatively skewed. So that's not cherry picked data, and it does end up fitting my narrative. Happy?
That is not how numbers work. There are more 1s than 10s. Remove extremes and you get a 5.9. I'm not here arguing it was good, just the hypocrisy going around here.
... Read those sections
Oh, yeah. Definitely rushed.\n\nThe fact that the very things that drew me into the show (Whitewalkers) were decimated in a single episode was upsetting.
Fckin Bron. His plot was stupid and lazy as shit. Like Brienne and Tormund they just kept him around for fan service at the end. I hated it. \n\nCan't wait for Greyworm to die from the butterfly disease in Naarth.
Some of the conversations were very private, it's not like Littlefinger bugged the place
Thats just poor writing.
Well the Night's Watch doesn't actually exist anymore so I guess he's got nothing else to do. \nI mean there's a huge hole in the Wall and Jon literally told the Wildlings they're welcome to come thru anytime (not to mention there's only about a hundred of them left so)
I could believe that Drogon just turned his head and the throne was in the way. He didn't burn Jon because he smelt of Targyreon, the throne was the next thing in his sight. An accidental irony. There's so much stupid stuff much worse that I'm going to let them get away with this one.
I could maybe buy that but he charges up and hits it again to really smother it which makes that reading way too generous
Nothing bothers people on this sub. They probably don't see any problem in the *council* scene.

Yeah, this sub. What a bunch of mindless plebs who have no understanding of cinematic elements? \n\nI thumb my nose at these people.\n\n/s
Ah. Thanks.
Exactly. People dont know we had the finale spoilers for months. Except nobody believed them because it sounded terrible. We thought there was no way D&D would air such garbage on HBO
And having this idea out there will affect perception. As you realize the leaks are true you are thinking about that and your preformed judgment instead of just taking it in for the first time.
because it was
Does that mean you didn\u2019t like a single thing about this episode?
It was the first episode that I wanted to finish as fast as possible because I started to get bored and stop caring. Eventhough, I liked the first 20-30 minutes, the directing and ridiculous situations the characters got themselves in (Tyrion literally being able to exacavate his brother and sister...) just took me out of the episode. Also, the second part was HORRIBLE it felt like a comedy!
Episode was boring and no I didn\u2019t like a single thing about it
A Single thing wouldn\u2019t even grant a 1/10. a ninety minute episode that\u2019s close to perfect is a nine, but if I honestly enjoyed just about five minutes and thought the dragon looks cool that\u2019s not a five, is it? I think I rated it about 4 or 5, but after a couple of days i feel worse about it.
Well that\u2019s idiotic
I actually though episode 6 made episode 5 way better because it made Dany\u2019s \u201cmad\u201d moment a little more understandable, but that\u2019s just me I guess.
Awesome how her victory lasted 20 minutes at most right
[deleted]
I hated this season but good god you're like all the worst parts of the internet in a single person.
That's what is mind blowing.  Even fan fiction is so much better than what we got.
r/asoiafcirclejerk
Im serious
Jon became pretty great, until this season when he was basically a lackey.
Yeah I agree. Jon became obsessed with honor and brooding, Arya obsessed with being a bad ass, and Sansa with power.
Not like there\u2019s many excellent arguments on this sub anyways
Sleepy? \n\n  I dont even know what to respond to that.\n\n  No?\n  I mean sure scenes were clearly stretched, particularly the one in the throne room. But sleepy?
I dont care, at least I am happy GoT fanboy, and you are bitter
Aren't they the producers and writers of the show since day one, since eleven years?
You know there is a saga of books called *A song of ice and fire* right?
Yeah.. I\u2019m down with the ending. But like if your going to put a monotoned 17 year old, that displays absolutely no emotion, creeps out everyone he comes into contact with, in the highest seat of power, you gotta leave some breadcrumbs for the people. You. Just. Gotta. \n\nDany went mad fine. We could have gotta over that one. Bran the one true king? No, that\u2019s not gunna fly, we need answers.
I used to defend it thinking they had to get all their pieces in place to set up for season 8.  Turns out they rushed season 7 so they could rush season 8 and finish be done with it once and for all.
I fucking hate what they did with Bran. He has explicitly stated that he cannot be Lord of Winterfell because he is the Three Eyed Raven now. He even said he\u2019s not even really a man. He made a bid deal about telling Jon his true heritage. Now all the sudden he wants to be King? He probably knew exactly what was going to happen with Danaerys and he said nothing. Fuck Bran and fuck these terrible writers.
If he had known, I wouldn\u2019t even be pissed. I mean if they spent the season showing bits that didn\u2019t make sense and left you questioning what bran was doing for it all to be revealed at the end. That may have possibly been good. But he was basically useless these past 2 seasons.
> He probably knew exactly what was going to happen with Danaerys and he said nothing. Fuck Bran and fuck these terrible writers.\n\nI think that's implied pretty heavily with the dragon vision over King's Landing back season 6 or whatever it was. But yeah that almost means that Bran/3ER was the ultimate villain in the end. They let everything happen or even nudged small things to make it happen just so the 3ER could become king. Really not sure if i'm a big fan of that
They completely fucked up so many characters. Bran, Danerys, Euron (was a great character that they wasted) Cersei, Arya. The only person that D+D actually gave a good story arch is Theon.\nThey should have done a lot more with Bran, and Euron honestly.
He lied. And, he's not Bran.  They all got outmaneuvered by Bloodraven
Literally said he didn't want to be king to Tyrion as it happened.
Isn't Bran on the throne presumably how GRRM told them it would end though?
To be fair, had he said something, someone would have tried to kill her meaning Cersei would have won, or should the killing be unsuccessful Dany would have done it anyways.
A very strange piece of writing, imo. Could nearly end up with Bran being viewed as a sort of Machiavellian figure, which I'm not sure was the writers' intention, but just illustrates how poorly executed the whole thing was..
I viewed the whole thing differently. He didn't want to be king, but since he's the three eyed raven he already knew that he would become king, so he did it to fulfill his destinay. Why was he chosen? Well that's sort of a paradox
I'd be interested to see a one off feature length episode showing what Westeros looks like in 100 years. With Bran being so passive and allowing so many disasters to happen, it would be interesting to see what he's like as a king. It would probably be like a HP Lovectaft story - eldritch being tricks everyone into making him king and goes on to turn his kingdom into a dystopian nightmare.
Where was the objection on religious grounds? Ebrose was writing a book but he wasn't at a grand council? Jim Broadbent didn't want to come back for one scene?\n\nHow can the septons have a different religion than the king without massive dissonance?
He doesn't want to be a king, but it was his responsibility to become one.\nBrans journey was to become a king which will lead Westeros to prosperity. He can see all previous king choices and consequences. He can see what happens in the world. And if he manages to grow weirwood, then he will be able to live long enough to give away his title for democracy.
Bran will be king in the books too.
Fucking writers!
Bran is very likely going to be king in the Books too. You calling GRRM terrible too?
Poorly written
That really grinds my gears. Literally 4 episodes before that he was talking about how he doesn\u2019t want to be Lord of anything. I feel like that was intentional misdirect by the writers, who again went for shock value versus logic
Plot twist. Bran/The Three eyed Raven learns to warg into Drogon and now that he has control of The Prince That Was Promised/The Stallion Who Mounts the World, cleanses the world by setting it afire, in the name of the Lord of Light. The Night King never wanted to end humanity. He wanted to stop the Three Eyed Raven from going on a rampage. People kept getting in the way, damnit!\n\nSEASON 9 CONFIRMED! GET HYPE!
Fantastic. You\u2019re hired
*\"One side's villain is the other side's hero.\"*
I still think they meant it as an upbeat line from him. I bet they just wanted to convey that he came all the way from kings landing, but the implication to the audience is that his whole journey and everything the realms went through was to get him on the throne.\n\nAnother victim of writing. Unless they intended it to make people think. Which could be the case, but than I'd argue they fumbled that. Cause it just warrants a \"H\u00e9? What the fuck?\"
I dunno, to me the line \"Why do you think I came all this way?\" implies prior knowledge. And he shouldn't be joking anymore anyways because he doesn't feel and isn't Bran anymore. Or is he? We will never know, because it flips and flops back and forth.
They clearly didn\u2019t realize how it sounded/looked in context\n\nNo surprise cause they suck
He said is like a sitcom joke. And then everyone chuckled, like, \"oh, Bran.\" The show acted like it was a funny aside, and didn't seem to understand the chilling implications of this statement.
It doesn\u2019t really matter either way tho, the implication is still the same that he knew he was going to be chosen.
As I said countless times since this \"sh\\*t\" happened, Bran was either the true villain of the story or a f\\*cking nobody that shouldn't get the throne/didn't deserve the throne (because of horrible character arc and lack of any personal connection to the throne).
>  bet they just wanted to convey that he came all the way from kings landing\n\nI really don't think this was what they were going for. It sounded like a *Everthing I did since season 6 was for this*
I heard that line and thought what you thought they intended, not the entire path of everything he's done.
You make great points about Bran, but everything you\u2019ve said is all examples that Brandon Stark did die when he became the 3ER.  We\u2019re still left trying to understand what the 3ER wanted exactly,  but it\u2019s safe to say he was after the Throne. He can see all possible futures and what better way to possibly end up on the Throne than through a Stark.  Is he a villain that just wants control or did the 3ER want to end tyranny as well? I do wish the story could have filled in the missing pieces,  but I think the first step in understanding it is that Bran is not sitting on the Throne it is the 3ER.
Yeah one of my biggest issues was not giving a single fuck about White Walker/CotF/3ER lore in the final two seasons
At least in the books, Bran is turning into a monster.  Jon, who has powers in the books, gets a lesson that basically amounts to a lesson in how to not be an evil wizard.  Bran is checking every box.  What he does to Hodor is an abomination in the books and pretty explicitly meant to be magical rape.  Bran knows it is wrong but does it constantly because it makes him feel good.  There are also worrying signs that he may be about to use Hodor to rape Meera.  He has also eaten human flesh both with his own hands and through his wolf.  Incidentally, Arya also murdered and ate a shepperd while dreaming in her wolf.
End tyranny after possibly manipulating Dany into killing everyone and giving access to the NK? LUL better luck next King :P In my opinion, he is the true villain of the story. Him and Dumb&Dumber. *So many plot holes :'(*
Why would Tyrion even back him!
I think we are absolutely led to believe that Bran's \"I don't want\" is sincere and that Varys (?) saying the best king is one who doesn't want it is a correct assessment. The end of the series is showing us the dawn of a new era and I think we are meant to believe in and embrace it. The king is innocent and all-knowing, the council is (with the exception of Bronn) made of people who only want the best for everyone, and the hereditary line of kingship is gone (which is what caused all this trouble in the first place.) I think theorizing that the 3ER was somehow a villain seizing control for nefarious purposes can be interesting but ultimately doesn't seem supported by anything and is not how we're supposed to interpret that ending. We can take this point at face-value.
I think Bran's arc never happened in the last seasons. He is not a mastermind strategist, he is someone who can see every moment happened in the past. Bran arc stopped with \"Hold the Door\" becoming the three eyes raven, a no human who has no interest in the humanity politics and only to preserve the world, nature and the order of things. Then, in episode 6 season 8 that status jumped directly to mastermind strategist who was always playing the game of the throne. There has been no arc, no sense, the directors didn't make bran develop into that direction. Seems like they just picked the one who was less likely to become king to shock audience because GoT always shocked audience, they thoight they could recreate shock as for example the \"Red Wedding\" did. \n\nOr maybe it was their goal since the start but they still wrote it awfully and this happened because they needed to rush it. They had 2 years to shoot so much footage and they even ended to waste those years by not being able to put those scenes together. \n\nFantastic acting. Fantastic CGI. Beautiful scenes if picked one by one. But it was all rushed, there is no real timeline between scenes they are just glued together. Lots of fanservice and Disney-like forced things. The ending season that a well written show like GoT  didn't deserve
His character had the most potential, I honestly hate how rushed this season was.
It seemed that him and Sansa manipulated Jon to get rid of Daenerys, take the fall, and allow both of them to get into power. At least that's the way the show presented it. \n\nBran gets to be King. \n\nSansa gets to rule an independent North. \n\nJon gets to...go live in Alabama
Aka the bransa conspiracy.
Bran's whole character has been terribly handled. Turned into an emotionless robot in the last 2 seasons, zero build up towards him becoming King and no real role in the WW arc & explaining his powers.\n\nAnd then they expected people to be ok with him becoming King and giving him lines like that? WTF
While I agree that it was a mediocre arc, I don't understand where you're getting this \"he neglected to do anything because he wanted power\" thing. He's reacted to every situation the same; He's never made an attempt to influence results in any way and he always tells people that they were where they were supposed to be regardless of the \"good\" or \"evil\" aspects about it. This felt like the same thing to me. Of course he knows when bad things are going to happen, but he's never attempted to prevent or help with one of them before, I don't understand why people expected him to all of a sudden.
Yeah and we never heard from Meera again. Like what was the point of that journey? What would Meera think about him being the fucking King.
He just fucking dumps Meera with next to no emotion and people still think this emotionless robot should be King.
I hate bran, completely not thrilled about him getting the throne. But I truly don't believe Bran played everyone to get throne. Martin's end game was for someone who does not process any desire for power, greed, and vengeance to sit on the throne. Bran is the only one who fits that category. However, its hard to say for certain because the writers did such a shitty job with Bran's character, we have no idea wtf is actually going on inside his head. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvidence to support Bran's complete loss of any \"wants\" as he described it to Tyrion is his convo with Jaime in the Godswood. Jaime asked why he didn't tell everyone the truth about his fall. Bran replied \"you won't be able to help in this fight if I let them murder you\". Bran has no desire for justice or vengeance for what was done to him. Therefore his decision making process is one that completely lacks all personal desires. Which often corrupts the mind. \n\nJaime being sentenced to death for his crimes against Bran would have been just for the starks and bran but not necessarily the benefit to the realm at that time.
He's been manipulating events the entire time most likely...they just cut the show waaaay to short to go into those details.
There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever Bran has been manipulating anything outside of his throwaway \u201cshy do you think I came all this way\u201d line. I agree he *could* be manipulating things, but that is never remotely explained or developed upon
Bran is actually just Littlefinger. Littlefinger became a faceless man ya know? Bet your expectations are subverted
I like to think when he yelled \"FATHER!\" at the Tower of Joy, it gave Ned the idea to adopt Jon.
Especially from a character who doesn't consider himself human anymore and has said he doesn't want.
Imagine, creating a genius of evil w/o realising it. I knew they were bad but this... This is next lvl. Its so baaaaad its almost art
What's sinister about it? He repeated that he doesn't want to be King 2 minutes later. He came all this way because he knew he would be chosen and was willing to take on that responsibility, that's all.
\n> What's sinister about it?\n\nBecause it briefly implies he was manipulating events the entire time.  \n\n> He came all this way because he knew he would be chosen and was willing to take on that responsibility, that's all.  \n\nSo lets ignore the fact his election makes less sense than the tuxedo football scene in *The Room* - The question everyone should be asking is Why? Why is he willing to take on this responsibility? His whole point was that he was not Bran Stark anymore and that he wouldn\u2019t be the lord or ruler of anything? Why does Bran give a shit? His whole plotline has been *explicitly* about the great threat of the NK and how \u201conly he can stop them\u201d. He has never been involved with the KL storyline and his character has never had anything to do with either wanting to rule the kingdoms (like Dany) or being elected to positions of power (like Jon).  \n\nI *guess* you could make the argument that was the point and the kingdoms needed and desired a different kind of ruler but that also makes no sense because 1) hardly anybody in the dragonpit meeting even knew who Bran was, let alone what the 3ER is, and 2) the thematic principles of S8 (as awful as they were) is that development doesn\u2019t really matter and you just end up back where you started. But this theme is also kicked out the window at the end (or at least that was the intention) with Bran as king (which made no sense) and a mostly low-born small council (which also made no sense).  \n\nI just don\u2019t get the point of Bran or the point of the final message? I guess the point of the final message is inherent impossible to grasp because the *how* of the final message makes no sense, but the purpose of Bran could\u2019ve at least been explained - but nope, we don\u2019t even get a tiny bit of explanation into Bran\u2019s ultimate motives
\"WE\" still don't know fuck all about Bran...\n\nThat's such a huge assumption by people who don't know much about the show...\n\nIf you know everything about time and space- if you have cosmic knowledge, all of reality is spoiled for you.  You'll always know where to be and when to be.  It's the point of the 3 Eyed Raven.  He is ALL history All memories and all knowing... He's lost all enjoyment and excitement of life because he knows EVERYTHING.\n\nThis is why he never moved when the Night King was approaching him.  He knows Arya will kill him.  He's not Bran, he's the 4th wall breaking viewer of the series.  Imagine being told ALL of the story of Game of Thrones--Now you're a character in the story.  You'd always know where to be, what to do, etc.\n\nJust because you don't comprehend a story doesn't mean your ignorance gets to be the deciding factor in something.\n\nYou. Know. Nothing.
Well I liked most of the arcs, even Brans for the most part
Wanting the throne and deserving the throne are very clearly shown as two separate things throughout the season. Bran isn\u2019t saying he came all this way because he wanted the throne the whole time, he came all this way cause he wants what\u2019s best for the realm and that\u2019s him being king
Okay fair point. But Bran has never shown any qualities that in the eyes of 99% of Westeros' inhabitants would make him deserving of throne
~~It's so 2000s action movie ending line~~ \n\nIt's so 2000s *straight-to-DVD* action movie ending line
It\u2019s so 2000 *made-for-tv* movie ending line
Obviously because he sees it as his duty and \"what must happen\" according to his knowledge. That doesn't mean he wants it ??? Yes the script was really bad at times, but so is this complaint
>letting hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians die\n\nThis implies that he could have done anything about it to  begin with. Do please tell. How could Bran have stopped any of those events from unfolding? Not defending the show, cuz it turned to shit, but this seems unfounded.
Bran didn't have to tell Jon about his true heritage. Also since Bran can probably see glimpses of the future, and also has infinite knowledge of the past why didn't he tell Dany to use the secrete passageway which Jaime used to send some elite soldiers to go kill Cersei? Not to mention Bran would know that Euron had equipped his fleet with a whole boat load of scorpions and could have saved her dragon. It looks to me like he subtly manipulated events to go his way, even though Dumb and Dumber probably didn't intend for that to be the case
And he even insisted multiple times before when others pointed out that he was the rightful Lord of Winterfell that the 3 Eyed Raven can't be a Lord.
Exactly
They apparently cut a scene that showed exactly that Arya or Sansa and Bran conversation.
I thought that him becoming the 3ER so quickly basically fried is brain in a way. Since he really wasn't ready to be the 3ER. Maybe the OG was ready. Idk, just how I interpreted it I guess.
This is how I see it. I mean, he was pushed to become the 3ER too soon because of his own mistake of letting the Night King touch him in his vision. Then, his most loyal friend (Hodor) had to be sacrificed so he could survive - and Bran was the reason he talked like a Pok\u00e9mon. Robo-Bran seemed to be more like a coping mechanism than a side effect of being the 3ER
That's what I thought too, but I think they should've just made him be like that for the rest of season 6 and the first bit of season 7, give him some time to come back to normal and have actual character development.  After all, he was still emotional when he plugged into the tree and learned about Jon when telling Meera \"I'm the three eyed raven now, I have to do this.\"\n\nBut then after that he's just \"beep boop \ud83d\udcdf \ud83e\udd16\". Pretty much ruined his character making him so boring and truly a disservice to Isaac H. Wright by giving nothing interesting to do for the rest of the series.
I think part of it is that the character is a lot harder to translate from book to screen than others. I think the showrunners lost investment in the story and they ended up not doing the work to translate the character well, so we got stuck with robo-Bran. Idk still stupid.
Or Moonboy for all I care. No way to learn that given the question that was asked.
I think it's safe to presume that Bran is nowhere near 'second-favorite Stark'.
oh!
Vegisexual
It's spelled vedgetabel, right?
Agreed, Ned was a great character. He really was the one to get everything rolling.\n\nSansa is also pretty aight, wish she had done anything in season 8 like actually contesting Dany after she murdered Kings Landing, probably would have made her my favorite.\n\nThe other Starks are aight to meh,\nJon and Arya are just huge Mary Sues with a shit ton of plot armor and both were kinda ruined by season 8. \nCait had less depth when compared to the books. \nRob has always been a rather minor character. \nRickon is a joke.\nBran is straight up a huge plot hole.
I think she needed to spell it out for Jon as he seemed to be a bit slow in season 8.
SHE IS MAH KWEEN
It's like he knows nothing
First rule of great screen-writing (by D&D): tell, don't show.
She also spent 8 out of 8 seasons murdering various people, but sharp catch by Arya there.
That was horrific writing. My friend and I actually laughed \u201clike no shit she\u2019s a genocidal maniac not a killer.\u201d
What did you expect? Good dialogue from the writers? Haven\u2019t you heard? They got better things to do now...
>Yeah and dany was insane, Jon was stupid, Geoffrey cruel, Tommen weak, Tywin ruthless.  Each characters qualities whether they be likable or not contributed to this amazing story.\n\nThank you! I never got the hate for Catelyn. She wasn't one of my favourites, but I really liked her. I don't know. Did she have some irritating moments? Yeah. And as you said, SO DO ALL THE CHARACTERS. Even Jon, for fuck's sake. And I don't see as much hate in those cases lol
dunno, she was irredeemable for me. Acted like a cunt towards Jon who didn't do anything and then betrayed Robb by releasing Jaime like a stupid cunt
So he has 1 thing to Bran at least since he could walk. That's good to know :P
The S7 and S8 trope of Tyrion blindly trusting Cersei at every turn just made no sense whatsoever. The dude knows better than anyone that she's a back-stabbing bitch mainly out for herself. What the hell made him think that she would risk thousands of her soldiers when she instead had the opportunity to have Daenerys Targaryen and her entire forces obliterated?\n\nThen again, her being back-stabbing also changes depending on whether it's convenient for the plot. She sends Bronn to have Tyrion executed with the same crossbow he killed Tywin with, but for some reason no one has explained to me yet, she doesn't immediately kill him, Dany and her advisors or Drogon when they're all in range for the dozens of scorpion bolts ready to fire at them at Missandei's execution.
Tyrion as a character had to explain the poor writing every time he said \"I made a mistake. I shouldn't have trusted Cersei. I thought she had something to fight for.\"
She tried to kill him. Did he forget? Like dafuq? That whole thing was huge and made him hate everyone in KL.
Cersei kind of forgot she wanted to kill Tyrion.
It's probably because she let Tyrion know that she is pregnant. Anyone watching the show knows that Cersei is COMPLETELY driven by her children.  \n\nWhether Cersei thought the NK would actually get to Kings Landing or not, Tyrion thought that she wouldn't risk letting her child be destroyed by the WW.
I think Tyrion's plan was to get the throne at the end. He was playing Machiavelli. I mean, why snitch on Varys? It seems like he was manipulating people to turn on each other except his siblings. If this is the case, the director failed horribly at portraying this. It just doesn't make any sense how the characters acted so stupidly in the end compared to the early seasons.
That entire fucking episode of \u2018walk and talk for 20 steps, then stop and poignantly look into the distance,\u2019 was such bullshit. People loved it at the time however.
It was pointless at the time, but I kept holding out hope that there would be some payoff down the line... But no...
The annoying thing is they didn't even need a Dragon to cross the wall. They could just walk around the pass on the western side of it.
>It was pretty clear that the writers knew they wanted the NK to have a dragon.\n\nIf they only wanted NK to have a dragon they could have found a dead *somewhere* for him to raise.
>Cersei made it seems like she would be convinced?\n\nRemind me to murder the inventor of the withheld information trope. And the [Unspoken Plan Guarantee](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee) trope. I hate them with a vengeance and classify them as \"How to give dramatic revelations a half-hearted attempt by being vague.\"
If you think about it these  guys are rich and all they have to do is find a creative way to give the NK a dragon.\nAnd thats what they come up with.
I'd say losing only half your forces against a neverending army of the undead is a pretty good score.
This will also happen
Maybe add some rank-order questions instead of absolute or check all that apply questions. \n\nFor worst decision, maybe have us rank order a list, e.g., (1. Jon et al trying to capture a wight 2. Ned trusting little finger/warning Cersei beforehand 3. Dany listening to Tyrion about Cersei/not going off to burn the iron fleet/not attacking KL/anything 4. Queen Cersei choosing to not have at least one child by Bobby B 5. Robb agreeing to marry a Frey girl and then reneging 6. Oberyn not finishing off the Mountain/standing too close while interrogating him) \n\nDefinitely re-ask the who should\u2019ve died question with almost all of the characters sill alive (J, S, A, B, T, ST, G, P, Bron, BoT) and use rank-order. Same with who do you wish had lived longer or to the end. \n\nFor rank-order Qs you can analyze them by assigning point values for each rank then averaging across users: 1=10 pts, 2=9 pts ... (or how ever many options you list 1=5 pts, 2=4 pts). \n\nGreat job on these btw!
The idea of starting a rewatch and knowing that is going to be the end just puts me off.
Ah, I was saying that because almost none of the characters got the ending in his arc. For example, all the scenes of Arya being obsessed with Cersei, all the scenes of the NK vs Jon Snow stare-off, etc. They have no meaning in the \"end game\", so I lost my interest to all of them.
I just think he\u2019s so honorable he wont go back to Winterfell just to show he accepts the decision. Which is completely stupid. Futhermore, they dont need a nights watch anymore.
Right? The white walkers are dead and the wildlings are friends, what the fuck are they guarding against now?
That's the point I think
Yes Sansa is a Queen and can pardon him or give him sanctuary
Everyone seems to miss the fact that the whole point of this was to break the wheel and that can't be done by going back on deals. Jon is exiled. If he just goes to chill at Winterfell and Dany's remnant finds out, they march on Winterfell. The Ironborn join them. Does Bran, who isn't even Bran, send his armies to aid his family, even though they subverted an official sentence? Would that not make them enemies of Kings Landing? Bran won't give a shit but the other Lords might not appreciate the North having free reign to do whatever they want.\n\nKeeping Jon in exile, while sucky, blocks events that could spiral into new wars, and then where the fuck are we? Right back to the Game.
That works well if all of Danny's remaining supporters weren't on a boat heading for Naath before Jon even left king's landing
Yeah but D&D are going to subvert expectations and ruin it *more*
Honestly? I think Star Wars would be perfect for them. They chose cisual spectacles over story this season on Thrones, and I think that would suit Star Wars fairly well
It was interesting until he returned to castle black. From that point forward he just sat around doing nothing except saying something creepy once an episode.
Meera fans represent.
Osha as well
Why were they not at the council along with whatever lady is currently head of house Frey, and all the other nobles houses
I agree the end of Bran's story was dumb and pointless, but his journey has been the most interesting and intriguing to me through out the show - just to show a different opinion
Honestly, it always bored me personally - I just didn't find it or him interesting, and when he came back after being absent from Season 5 I just didn't care at all anymore.
Seriously, it's like that in Itchy and Scratchy episode 2F09, when Itchy plays Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone, he strikes the same rib in succession, yet he produces two clearly different tones. I mean, what are we to believe, that this is a magic xylophone, or something? Ha ha, boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.
I guess it\u2019s just me, but I read that as \u201che came all this way\u201d because he knew he had to be king in order to \u201cbreak the wheel\u201d. Idk maybe I\u2019m giving them too much credit, but I actually like the Bran on the throne decision. What I can\u2019t agree with, is the lack of a natural storyline to get there. Like they should\u2019ve shown Bran using his powers to make correct decisions about some events between him becoming the 3ER and now, to at least give a viable reason for him being a good king. Instead he was just cryptic as shit and confirmed R+L=J, and that\u2019s pretty much it.
They've already said no spinoffs with the current characters. I think arya exploring west would be pretty shitty honestly.
Well no. That was the thing. He originally wouldn't do it, but Varys convinces him:\r\r> What about the lives of your children, my lord? Is that a precious thing to you?\r\rYes, he's leaving his kids. But presumably they would be with the Lannisters, which obviously that's better than them being dead. (For all Ned knows, they could be tortured or killed if he doesn't give a confession)\r\rAlso Cat and Robb are still alive, so they could hopefully get the kids back at some point.
That's why he finally choose to recognize king Joffrey as the true king, before getting his head chopped off anyway. Which makes his end even more tragic, frustrating and schoking. They break him, and he accepts his entire life of honor to be destroyed, for nothing.

Then why was everything green and full of green grass and trees when they showed the scene of the night king's creation. That was \"beyond the wall\" as well. (the wall wasnt technically there yet but the location is north of the soon to be built wall)
I mean basic story telling, if you read, watch or write a story and the first reaction to something that happens is \"wow thats kinda dumb, why wouldn't they just do/say ______\" then its bad writing. \n\nLike with the battle of winterfell, did they make the battle plan by our heros stupid because otherwise it would have seemed like the night king and his army wasn't that strong? if thats the case make the battle plan by our heros water tight, have it on paper so that by all accounts they should win the fight, then just make the night king that much more that even the best plan is nothing compared to him, they spent 7 seasons building up how the nk and his army are the unstoppable death of the world so there was no risk of him seeming \"to strong\" that was the point.
> \"This is a fantasy series with dragons and magic, it doesn't have to make sense!\"   \n\nIn other words, \u201cJust don\u2019t think about it\u201d
That argument is exceptionally stupid for Game of Thrones, because what the series has always excelled at is that even in a world with magic and heroes and prophecies that really come true, *the politics make sense.*
I wish they never chose D&D in the first place, i knew it was inevitable that they'd fuck it up, cause i don't think anyone had ever heard of Dan Weiss before GoT, looking at his IMDB page and it's completely empty other than very very small projects. And Benioff made that Wolverine Origins movie which was horrible. I wish they'd grab someone like Guillermo del Toro, cause i think around the time they cancelled him for The Hobbit, they were starting to make GoT.
Yeah, seriously, you could make the same argument for Marvel movies which basically have what amounts to magic and fantastic creatures.
Someone fetch the westeros stretcher
Nah, the main characters just learned Instant Transmission from Goku.
[deleted]
Wasn't that during Robert's Rebellion?
And when she asked if he could forgive him he didn't even respond
Maybe if you just throw a bunch of symbols together it will mean something?
I swear the writers were purposely fucking with us.
That\u2019s what makes Bran being king so intriguing and why it\u2019ll probably be done much better if ADOS ever comes out. Before with the Night King you could justify Bran\u2019s letting everything happen like Theon\u2019s death because it all culminated with the killing blow that saved Westeros. And now he\u2019s probably let thousands die to become King, which was never even close to being part of his story, and yet all that time spent with the 3ER that we didn\u2019t get to see had to have been about becoming King. I really hope the prequels delve into this stuff more because it seemed like the end of GoT was a victory for the 3ER alone; Bran becoming King had to have been decades in the making, plus some evil 3ER\u2019s would be dope.
Dany is killing innocents because SHE thinks it\u2019s needed for her kind of \u201cgood\u201d; and she was gonna kill millions of others in order to reach her goal. But with Bran letting her kill those millions and setting up the distrust in her in the first place, he assured that she would be killed and couldnt kill more. I guess people see it as \u201che caused Dany to kill a million\u201d but I see it more as a \u201che made sure she couldnt kill MORE than a million\u201d. You could say that he couldve tried to make it so she wouldnt kill a million in the first place, but maybe this was the only way to reduce her kills while also breaking the wheel for the a better distant future.\n\nTotally agree, there really isnt a good, right proper answer, at least until the books!
That stills has the implication that Dany was *right* to torch King's Landing though, if that was the best future from Bran's perspective
The visions are somewhat unclear, but I don't think he can scan the future and act to change it. He only ever acknowledges the fact that events happen because they *have* to. He gives meaning to what happens a posteriori, but he doesn't act to change it in advance (because he can't really know what will happen).
He already manipulated events with Hodor. It's obviously possible.
Or the first responses could've been Bran lying. \n\nIf the 3ER were lying in the end, he'd have no reason to have told the truth in the beginning in the first place. I think it's more plausible that he's been telling the truth the whole time.
The future may not have been changed by Jon\u2019s choice. If Jon had not said anything there is no guarantee Jon\u2019s heritage could not have been found out a different way. Maybe Sam decides he needs to tell someone for revenge? Maybe Tyrion over hears Dany and Jon discussing it? The fact that Jon did spill his secret was a betrayal to Dany which escalated her \u201cmadness\u201d, but it still could have played out the same. The news gets leaked without Jon making the choice,  but Dany feels unloved because the people love Jon. Jon stepped back from Dany the moment he learned of his heritage and I believe that hurt Dany as much as him spilling the news. She chose fear when Jon refused her love. She still lost people close to her which also played into her reaction at KL.
He can't see the future, he only knows that things move in a deterministic way and that whatever happens is what *has* to happen. This has always been his attitude since becoming the 3ER. He doesn't push for things to happen, he just acknowledges that there is only one way they could have happened.
First Bran can't see the future, he can only see visions, out of context scenes that may happen, but the show does a really poor job explaining us what his powers are so I really can't blame you\n\n\nSecondly, do you have a girlfriend? Imagine you have done something bad and your best friend comes over \"TacoMagic it's your choice if you want to tell her what you did\"\n\n\nIs there any possible outcome where you don't tell her and don't spend the night on the couch?
So he's afflicted by visions... of the future... that don't make any sense and he can't do anything with... sounds like a fun ability to have... like a stroke jumping tv channels that he can share with others but it ultimately means nothing because the ink is dry... hurray...\n\nI would not conflate to \"Jon knowing his true identity\" and then telling his immediate family, the thing he literally just said he was going to do.. as \"hiding something from my girlfriend she eventually finds out and I sleep on a couch\" ?\n\n\"Why do you think I came all this way\"\n\n\"It's your choice\" \n\n3EyeRaven playing these fools.
He coulda told arya about the fate of kings landing if he knew, arya would believe him cuz he knew of her list, sansa knows of her faces, and believes bran has \"visions\". Arya could just assassinate danny wearing a face of anyone. Hell danny called her hero of winter fell, she sees arya as no threat to her life anyways even if word gets to her of aryas powers.\n\nIf bran knew and didnt get arya to kill her first.. that to me is weird logic
Really? I\u2019m like the complete opposite. Even as a kid, I was rooting for James Bond to die in Goldeneye just because I liked Sean Bean as 006 so much.
>006\n\n007*\n\nEdit: I apparently need to relearn how to read. Ignore me.
Rob and Jon were boy scouts, too.
Oh I must have missed how they counted every variation of every word.
Personally I don\u2019t expect OP to pay for a program to do something that is not necessary. I don\u2019t know about you
I mean if I'm planning to analyze >100k qualitative data points I would. Although I'm sure there are open source alternatives that can do this.
It deserves as many upvotes as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had nobles.
And it died at the hands of a Frenchman of all things...
    it had a degree of religious tolerance that was missing from England, Spain and France\n\nYou're joking, right? The 30 year's war didn't happen? And the only reason it didn't kick off much sooner was because the HRE was not a state but a loose federation.
You will note how I qualified that in the statement you are replying to and then realize why your response is missing the point.
If Bran is immortal, why was he worried about the NK killing him?
I think he meant to say that Bran can't die of age, so he would live forever if not killed. Personaly, i don't subscribe to that theory, cause the previous three eyed raven only lived that long by merging with a weirwood tree. I doubt that's a possibility for bran as king.
Because the writers wrote that. It doesn\u2019t make sense just because it was written. Why would the white walkers target Wikipedia instead of the A10 Warthogs? Just because Bran was worried, it doesn\u2019t mean it was justified. Out of all the things that don\u2019t make any sense, Bran being worried about dying doesn\u2019t really rank high up the list.
Immortal\u2260Invincible.
That's 4 years old, and it is exactly my point.   \n\nThis season,  she just repeats it like a catch phrase, and it certainly doesn't mean what it did in that clip.  She used it a chant to fire up her army to go and conquer all known lands.\n\n\"Daeny kinda forgot what 'break the wheel' meant.  But the wheel didn't forget about her.\"  if I can be allowed to meme about it.
D&D realized that Dany breaking the wheel was a little too sympathetic because *almost every other character on the show* wants to keep the wheel regardless of their sympathetic perspectives.\n\nIt would literally become Dany versus everyone. Which would be entertaining as all hell, but it would also mean half, if not most, of the audience would find themselves rooting for Dany against the entire Stark family. Which would also be incredibly entertaining but hard to write around.\n\nBasically, the Great Houses are the wheel. How do you write a show where all of the good guys support a horrible system that only one or two of the good guys want to tear down? D&D broke in favor of a fucked-up system that likeable characters mindlessly support instead of a morally grey and sometimes divisive character tearing down the fucked up system that the likeable characters mindlessly support.\n\nWhich is why Tyrion straight-up lies at the end and says that Dany's dream was to make sure the spokes on the wheel stay intact.
Yet people wanted to name the episode \"The Broken Wheel\".  Sorry but to me that's a horrendous name, even with any sort of context, purely for the sake of #***SYMBOLISM***
~#Hashtag~
> That's what I call \"breaking the wheel\", at least in the world of ASOIAF.\n\nno, no no no, no. not at all.\n\nWhat you described is her being a spoke in the wheel, exactly.  And when she dies and has no kid, yet another succession war breaks out between everyone.  The wheel turns once more,  and the people suffer for it.\n\nWhat you describe is exactly the wheel, and Daeny keeps the wheel going full force.\n\nObviously,  breaking the wheel is a democracy/republic and a peaceful transition of power.   No more rights to the throne, no more birthright, no more 'name',  but replaced with people peacefully voting to elect a leader whose job is to serve the realm.  The exact opposite of Daeny and the \"Conquer the World\" message from the latest episode.
We've had medieval kings who specifically took power away from nobles and empowered commoners precisely because the nobles held enough land and wealth collectively to challenge them. Dany's plan wasn't anachronistic, and giving nobles the power to choose their king has more often than not led to more conflict than disempowering them.\n\nThe interesting thing is that a perfect situation for this is a character like Dany who can't follow hereditary succession. She wouldn't want power to be passed down generationally, especially given her experience with corrupt and bloodthirsty Targs and Lannisters.
You could see in his face that he didn\u2019t really mean those things. He was in a tough spot and really wanted her to be good but you can see the anguish in his face while saying those lines to Tyrion. He was having an internal battle of \u201clove vs duty\u201d He wanted her to be his queen and be good so bad that he was trying to convince himself that she was and at the end of the day he knew what had to be done. Sometimes when it\u2019s something that you want so bad but you know is wrong, you need some outside perspective to make the right choice. It\u2019s just like a lot of real relationships when you know you shouldn\u2019t go back with your ex but you do anyways. Jon just needed a friend to put it in perspective because he was blinded by love
That's the problem none of what you said is believable. That scene should feel like that but it just reads like a mix of stupidity and a little of bit of loyalty. Very uncharacteristic, and all to quickly push towards a quick resolution.\n\nJon was made stupid in general and they forced in an unbelievable love/loyalty to fill in any remaining games. He was just a tool to push certain plot points and ultimately made him useless wood as a character.
I agree but 51% did not
I was angry about the ending at first because It didn\u2019t make sense due to how rushed it was. But once I connected the dots through all the recaps and cast interviews I was able to make sense of It all and think It was a good ending. It was just executed absolutely terribly.
Yeah he did say that didn't he. The realm is so screwed
I was running under the assumption that Bran has forfeitted his claim on the North.  \n\nAlso Sansa was Lady of Winterfell when she declared independence, which made her Queen regardless.
It's been going on longer than that.
The lord of light wanted Danny dead?
Nah, he wanted Dany to help. Dany dying would only happen when the Lord of Light \"fucks off\".
would he have needed to be killed like that if Jon's plan hadn't given him the GD dragon in the first place?
Why is such a sensible post buried in this thread? It baffles me that there\u2019s so many people who failed to realize Jon\u2019s entire purpose and why he had to be a half Targ.
Thank you, it\u2019s been hard to find others who agree
Nah I don\u2019t see it that way, he was brought back to bring dany into the fold to defeat the night king and the kill dany before she become too powerful. He purpose was always to kill dany, and to help the defeat the NK not necessarily to kill him himself. When Melisandre goes to dragon stone she said to dany, you and the king in the north both have a role in this war. Danys purpose was served when the NK was defeated. It was only Jon left with one more purpose, kill dany.
Within the show, sure. But of course that raises the question of why the lord of light gives a flying fuck about Dany being alive/dead.
Except the night king got past the wall much faster with the dragon, Dany would probably have time to beat Cersei and take the kingdom pretty fast (even the North had Jon stayed dead). Also, the nk dying the way he died could have happened anywhere, anytime. Bran could have just seeked Arya, waited for a bit for him to show up, and have her ninja her way into killing him.
You think Arya/Sansa/anyone in the North is okay with Dany taking Winterfell? Dany probably kills all the Starks as she burns Winterfell down. The only reason that fight against the dead is close is because of the unity between Dany\u2019s forces and Jon\u2019s forces. Without him the Night King would find a way to win.\n\nAnd, again, even if this wasn\u2019t true. The Red god is a cruel one. It doesn\u2019t *need* to narratively pay off any more than Robb being the king in the north was
Nope. Drogon obviously showed interest in jon in multiple scenes in s7 and 8.
He looked at Jon a few times, therefore Drogon wouldn't kill the person that killed his mother?
It's implied that Mirri Maz Duur infected his wound worse instead of trying to heal it, but yeah. Point still stands.
In the books she tried to heal him but he rubbed sand on his wound(and it's implied she knew he would do that) and it got fucked up further. It's quite confusing
That's the power of the theatre, bitch.
Drogo was killed by the witch though
>I find the Hound's survival less likely than Arya's but people don't go on and on about that.\n\nI agree, Hound should have died. \n\nA \"small knife?\" Look at this [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/h8U43CI.jpg). Looks pretty damn long to me and the Waif buries that thing to the hilt twice and twists it around after the last stab. And you can't be serious about the lower right abdomen not containing any vital organs. That blade was going right in the approximate area where you'd find the right ascending colon and packed coils of ileum and jejunum.
No vital organs as in the stab wound is not going to kill you like if you got stabbed in the heart.  Its the risk of infection, which is likely but its not guaranteed.  I would have preferred them be less dramatic about it yes, but it is not immersive breaking.
See, but I don't think that's satisfying. I get it, life is tough, not everything has a happy ending. But him going back is just not narratively fulfilling. It's like you said, him dying while killing Cersei is palatable, but it's certainly not a happy ending.\n\nUsing your analogy, if I were to watch a story about a drug addict, where he spent the entire film getting rid of it, only to give in in the last 10 minutes and die of overdose... I'd leave completely unsatisfied. I guess that's the point, but it feels cruel just to send a message of \"sometimes things are cruel\".\n\nHe spends 8 seasons struggling with that. At the season 6 finale, he looks both pissed and disappointed at Cersei when he watches her sitting on the throne. Only for him to go back. Feels like an utter waste
Indeed. Which is why I said \"on the context of the show\". The books can have a lot of internal development and monologue. All D&D had to do was not feel obliged to keep the book's ending, and realize that the show is its own thing.\n\nWell, first they actually had to give a fuck to what they were writing.
Tbh D&D probably don't have the chops to make up their own ending to such a complex story to begin with (maybe if it's a generic fantasy story, but it isn't), so they continued to rely on Martin's plot points because at that point there's too much of Martin's touch for them to just abandon and make up their own plot points along the way. Don't think they could coherently bring converging storylines together without his bullet points, even Martin himself is struggling with this that's why his books aren't close to finished.
Interesting cause I totally disagree! I thought the execution was pretyy horrid too, but the bullet points make sense to me.\n\nBran ending up king reminds me of King Leto II in Dune, a ruler who knows the best possible outcomes for humanity. I dunno I just find it more interesting then Dany or Jon ending up on the throne. BUT, they did not do any work to make the ending work whatsoever.
Why even have a throne though? Isn't it clear that one person holding all seven kingdoms is fucked up?\n\n  \n\n\nHow about making all seven kingdoms independent again? I thought they were gonna do something like that when Drogon burned the throne, you know, symbolism and shit, but no... I guess he just wanted to burn it.
Thinking Arya has the most intriguing story and her winning the \u201cfavorite Stark\u201d vote is exactly why we ended up with her supermanning the Night King. It\u2019s fun to point fingers but I will always unequivocally hold you clowns responsible for liking her way too much and leading to the Long Night
Yeah I agree that it\u2019s completely silly to be intrigued by the person who can perfectly imitate anyone and is trained by some kind of crazy assassin school. Yeah, that\u2019s not even close to as intriguing as some of the regular people in GoT. You\u2019re right.
When I next rewatch the show I'm genuinely just going to imagine those storyline getting different endings and still enjoy the build-up.\n\n...at least, that's my hope, maybe I will fail :(
I'll just never re-watch it. There are too many deserving writers out there to waste time being reminded of this trash ending. Thank God D&D are going to Star Wars - a series that's already sucking cock in an alley for every dollar its worth.
The white walker threat was barely a threat lmao, like no one died, they didn't need cersei, they didn't need anything, the only reason the wall even falls is because of Jon's stupid northern expedition.\n\nTry again.
6 named characters died, including two who have been in the show from season 1. They didn't get Cersei, but Jon is responsible for getting Dany to the fight, unifying the north, and getting just about every member of the cast minus Cersei, Qyburn, and Euron there, ultimately. And yes, the wall falls because of him, another way his arc is significant, just as Ned's is significant even though he dies and screws his entire family.\n\nI'm not saying the white walker plotline this season is a masterpiece. But to say Jon's arc doesn't matter because he doesn't stab the night king is absurd.
\"What the hell is wrong with Critics?!  THAT WAS AN AWESOME MOVIE!\" Angry Joe Suicide Squad review.\n\nYeah, no, I wince every time Angry Joe steps outside his comfort zone of videogames,  his TV show and movie reviews lack nuance to say the very least.
Yea, it seems like choosing the lesser of two evils lol. But yea, the North also seems like a dreadful place to live, maybe that influenced a lot of choices as well.
That is what it ends up being, sadly lol That probably did, the south seemed beautiful. However I live in a place like the north irl anyway so it would not be much of a change lol
His men where in a very defensible castle
With no hope of relief against a much larger force.
With a few more episodes her turn would have been believable. The worst thing imo was choosing Bran while not even mentioning the only two legitimate claims.
Or even Gendry now that he was made legitimate.
That was the second worst thing for me. The only set up for that that I can think of is that in Winterfell Tyrion asked him about his story. That is literally it. Add to that he said he doesn't want anymore. However when it comes to being king it is a ln entirely different story. \n\nOn the Aegon side of things, I can see him not being king and I would be okay with it. The injustice comes that not even one person mentioned him. WTF. How can you not at least mention him?!
The rightful heir was Gendry Baratheon, legitimized son of the King of the 7 Kingdoms of Westeros, when they were last unified.\n\nBy any 'modern' Westerosi view, his claim is better than anyone's.\n\n(Edit for clarity)
They didn\u2019t even mention the idea of Jon being king. All the talks Varys and Tyrion have about how Jon would make a great king? For nothing. All of the letters Varys sent to the other lords revealing Jon\u2019s true heritage? Never brought up again.\n\nI mean we all know Jon \u201cdint wahnt it,\u201d and I\u2019m not even saying he should\u2019ve been king, but it should\u2019ve at least been discussed.
I think that was ultimately the biggest problem here. It felt really rushed. I think that they could have even made this ending work if they put more effort and thought into it. Just not a quick gathering out of nowhere that instantly decides who becomes king.
Not to mention that her ending speech to her soldiers was one of the most over-the-top evil speeches I\u2019ve seen in years. It felt like it was 1 step away from being a speech Hitler would\u2019ve given. So much for subtlety.
It might have actually been more subtle if she did the nazi salute at the end. \\s\n\nIn addition to the speach, I know the unsullied have always been a little robotic, but the whole scene had an autocratic feel to it.
Really? She's been really vindictive and brutal from day one....
There is a large difference between being harsh toward your enemies and setting hunting down innocent people as you burn the entire city.\n\nAlso note, there was a time her dragons torched a kid and she locked them away because of it.
I feel the same way. I am hoping that going back to season 7 and then reading some fanfiction that I might be able to make it alright in my head.\n\nI also hope GRRM finally releases the rest of it. Although I don't know how much more tragedy for Daenerys I can take lol
I wouldn't go that far. Season 1-4 were amazing. 5 was pretty good too, 6 was a mix and 7 was pretty bad in hindsight. Season 8 was like someone poured gasoline on a dumpster fire and then launched it into the friggen sun.
I wonder how much longer you'll continue to whine about it on the internet then? A few more weeks?
because it objectively is shit?
Objectively is the new literally I see
Didn't know about the Sansawinsfanclub but the DanandDavefanclub can not exist with a negative opinion on the show and asoiafcirclejerk is a joke subreddit as are all circlejerk subs.  These subs are hardly a fair bar by which to measure anything.  This sub has been the champion of the show when compared to the other two significant asoiaf subreddits on this site and most other asoiaf non reddit forums.  It isn't that the sub is negative, it is that the show tanked.
Dan and Dave fan club? I just threw up in my mouth.
Which honestly says a lot more about you than them. Really, stop shitting on other people who just want to enjoy something.
I don't want to watch star wars where a plot point is one character forgets that another can use the force. Im in 2 minds to not see it, but i really love star wars.
Disney should of realised that GRRMs books were carrying those two. D&D were only good when they adapted existing material from the book, not when they actually had to write (even then they had a blueprimt).\n\nIf anything Disney should of hited GRRM to write a trilogy, my god I would love to see that \ud83d\ude02
I was already kind of done with Star Wars, the Disney movies were disappointments for me and TLJ was the last nail in the coffin.\n\nNow it's like they're going to pry open the coffin, take a dump in it, and seal it back up again.
I'm just waiting for those two to also abandon starwars as they are offered another job somewhere else like they appear to have done with GoT
You guys sound like crazy people do you actually stop to read what you write? WTF am I reading here.
This exactly. Dany's forces were ridiculously overpowered at the end of Season 6. So the writers threw in a bunch of absurd *anti*-deus ex machinas like:\n\n1. Euron's ability to completely surprise and devastate her fleet even though she had Yara who is also a top notch Iron Born seafarer\n\n2. Taking Casterly Rock in a brilliant surprise assault only for Highgarden to fall like it was made of wet newspaper \n\n3. ~~Losing essentially all of her forces at the Battle of Winterfell~~, no that's not it, ~~only half were gone~~, no that's not it either, actually everyone respawned for the attack on KL\n\n4. Losing 2 of her 3 dragons, including Rhaegal to three \"360 No Scope\", \"1 in a million\" shots in 10 seconds after she \"kind of forgot\" about the Iron Fleet even though they talked about it in the same episode minutes before\n\nIt was all ~~a bait and switch~~ *subverting expectations* to make it seem like it was going to be a struggle, all for Dany and Drogon to dunk on Cersei and her armies like Lebron playing some kindergarteners anyway.
I blame the decision to cut Aegon.
Even the deus ex machina fail because if she can cause that mu h destruction with 1 dragons, why bother killing the second especially when in the next episode you bump up the power level by 9000
No one in their right mind would march their entire army to Highgarden and leave KL undefended. When you know someone is trying to attack. \n\nThe whole plot of attaching Harrenhal was dumb as fuck as well.
Yup. And in 7.01 she still had 3 dragons and there were no scorpions.  She could have burned the Red Keep without touching anything else and she would have won.
Literally barely even needs her dragons in 7.01. All that needs to happen is this:  \n\nTyrion - \u201cSo I destroyed the vast majority of Stannis Baratheon\u2019s fleet with wildfire and he still *nearly* took the city. You have way way more forces than Stannis did, so you will go to KL and have the Unsullied and Dothraki break through the Mud Gate and kill the Lannister army. The Unsullied do as you command and the Dothraki think you\u2019re a God so they won\u2019t rape and pillage if you tell them so\u201d. \n\nVarys - \u201cAlso, I know all the Red Keep passage ways. Why don\u2019t you send me with Grey Worm and a few of your other top Unsullied killers and i\u2019ll show them the passages to Cersei\u2019s room.  \n\nDany - \u201cGreat thinking boys. It\u2019s a plan!\u201d  \n\nYara - \u201cWell my Uncle  Euron has a huge fleet, what if they try to attack us?\u201d  \n\nDany - \u201cLol I have dragons\u201d.  \n\nYara - \u201cFair point\u201d.
I mentioned this same thing during 8.05, why the fuck didn\u2019t she just sack Kings Landing BEFORE the battle with the dead? If 1 dragon took it that easily then 3 dragons wouldn\u2019t have even needed a single ground troop to help. AND Cersei didn\u2019t have any scorpions then.
Because she listened to Tyrion's dumbass advice that's why.
in season 7 dany didn't want to burn the city and she thought cersei was gonna help against the dead until 8.02. there's a lot of things in the last four seasons that i thought didn't make sense but i don't think this one is anywhere near the worst offender.\n\nedit: as i've so far gotten three responses to this comment i thought i'd clarify. i agree that it doesn't make sense which is why i didn't say it did but i do think that it still fits with dany's goal of avoiding killing innocents in 7.01. we've seen in the previous seasons and the books that the red keep doesn't house just lannisters so it's not too unfair to assume that there are people who are relatively innocent living there. indimitation might work but she'd still have to demonstrate the power of the dragons to the lannister soldiers somehow. i agree that she could've and should've seiged the city at the start of season 7. i did forget that dany doesn't learn about the army of the dead until later on in the season and i don't think she believed it until 7.06.
At that point, they dont know yet the nightking is a pushover vilain so they think they need Cersei army against him
This. Episode 3 had lots of fanboys defending it but it was a trainwreck and killed 7+ seasons of build up and ruined multiple story arcs. It wasn't even one of the best battle episodes
Was the worst battle episode they had and the worst episode in terms of thematic butchering
I was in denial that it was bad...looking back arya killing NK was fucking lame.
Lol at least the NK got a dragon out of that and raised huge amounts of hype for season 8 (lol)\n\nIn this season every time someone did something incredibly stupid it had 0 payoff.
Yep.  As stupid as the whole thing was I was super excited that the Night King got a dragon.  In fact....the dragon battle between the Night King, Jon and Dany in E3 might be my favorite part of season 8.
[removed]
No, it\u2019s brainless to judge and be insulting someone who likes something different than you.\n\nGrow up...
If you factor in that is the finale and absolutely is a disastrous end to the show then yes.\n\nAs a standalone episode sure I'll give it a generous 3/4
I can see people giving it a 4, but 1? Is it the actual worst thing that you ever watched on television? Seriously?
Why. Arya is a much worse character
Both of them are completely selfish, but at least Arya selfishly wants to murder bad people, whereas Sansa selfishly wants to hoard power at the expense of her siblings and everyone else. Arya doesn't really affect anyone else, whereas Sansa just single-handedly destroyed Bran's kingdom because she's always wanted to be a queen since she was a little kid - not to mention that she may have driven Dany to madness by betraying Jon's trust. Sansa's selfishness has much larger negative effects.
I personally like both the show and the books; and can appreciate them for the aspects that each medium excels at.
if the books ever get finished, I'll probably give it a go again.  should be more enjoyable now that I know it's not high fantasy.
I DEMAND A TRIAL BY COMBAT\n\nBack when the writing was good
I hated that.\n\nGrey Worm: YOU WILL NOT SPEAK!\n\nTyrion: okay cool, but I'm just going to anywau
YOO, Arya and Yara have the same letters in their names
It\u2019s GOT\u2019s \u201cyour mother\u2019s name was Martha????\u201d Moment.
Found the guy who gave it a 10. ^\n\nKidding.
Why did Yara vote for the little brother of the dude that killed her queen she said she was still loyal to that she\u2019s never met? Tyrian\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t that good. Nothing about any of that episode made sense
Because Yara is secretely Jaqen H\\`ghar, duh
um.. she killed the nk?
She knows that how? Also, so? Since when did Yara become a sea bitch?
We didn't have any reaction to *Daenerys* dying. Drogon was the only person who gave a shit on screen.
Little bit from Tyrion and GW but nothing major yeah
> There's already a lot of suspense of disbelief required. So how come it's too difficult to just assume that Yara has been informed about the faith of Theon offscreen?\n\nI'm not saying that I don't believe that Yara was told about Theon's death offscreen, I fully believe that she was. My problem is that we got no acknowledgement of it at all. I felt like that was a really important moment that we missed so that we could watch Tyrian walk around King's Landing for a while longer.
Well, the entire ending felt a bit rushed. There was a lot they glanced over. That's indeed a bit of a problem I agree with. I still don't think that every character death needs to be accompanied by a scene where it shows how it affected their loved ones, especially given that Yara pretty much expected Theon and his comrades to die in their fight against the Night King.
Theon completed his arc, but I don't find the ending that satisfying. It's not problematic as all the other major characters, absolutely, but killing him felt very unnecessary and lazy even.\n\nPersonally, I'd keep him alive as right hand man of Sansa. I also feel like Jon should've died during his fight with the Night King, and then Sansa offers Longclaw to Theon, on an emotionally powerful scene similar to when Daenerys appointed Tyrion as her Hand.\n\nThere. The family that raised him, and that he once betrayed, now fully sees him as a man of honor and loyalty. Redemption arcs don't have to *always* end in death.
Yeah, Theon's death was unnecessary imo, which is why I said it was important only as far as he knew. Really he could've just hung back behind Bran and chilled while the NK took his sweet time and Arya did her thing. \n\nJon dying killing the NK would work, and would save us from three episodes of him serving absolutely no purpose.
Yeah that was as good as it got. Still, Cleganebowl felt incredibly forced. Cleganebowl is one of the best examples of forcing fan service. But yes, ultimately i guess it made sense, but I just didn\u2019t care by that point. It felt incredibly forced. But as far as thematic endings fir characters go it was fine
That was definitely my issue with Arya's arc this season, and a problem with the rushed pacing.  We know that Arya was consumed by revenge for a long time, and we could believe that her character to revert back to season 6 Arya and desperately want to kill Cersei.\n\nBut there is no buildup to how she regresses back, and no real reason why other than for the plot.  She already abandoned her first Cersei assassination mission after realizing she had family in WF, and unlike before, is actually close with Sansa.  She stresses to Jon again about the importance of family, and literally only a few minutes later in the episode decides to go kill Cersei and says she is willing to die to do so.  \n\nAnd the person who talks her out of her revenge mission at the last minute is Sandor, who suddenly decided to go on his own suicide mission to kill his semi-dead brother and is supposed to be the \"vengeful\" one of the two, when Arya was 10x times more vengeful than he ever was.
In season 1, when the Lannisters go after her father and she is practising with the sword master, she runs into the streets when a random boy grabs her and asks about her small sword needle. She reacts by stabbing him in the stomach. He falls and she keeps running. Later she tells the pie boy that she has killed a fat boy like him before and that he should be careful she doesn't do it to him too.  \n  \nEDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEvH5YCATg&feature=youtu.be&t=24
That was a reaction, not intentional.  Manslaughter at best.
I must be honest I forgot about that.
He was going to turn her over to the queen, who Arya probably thought would kill her
1) did you even read my comment?\n\nand if so \n\n2) did you even watch the episode? \n\nif so, refer back to question #1
I'm saying not only were the early seasons better written but they also had way better fights and action in the beginning . All the best fights are in the first 4 seasons. Season 7 skewed towards being just a battle/fighting season and wisely ignored politics/drama cuz they didn't know how to write it anymore. Season 8 skewed back towards drama and politics but it was all nonsense and pointless, it would've been better off being only battles and fighting.
yea thats my point, a lot of people who watch the show arent like us and are super super casual.
I can understand being casual. After all, not everyone can be super committed to things like TV shows, but there has to be a limit, right? \n\nApparently not lmao
Her name is Kelly C.!
Kelly C got mad about losing Miss Sandy
I\u2019ll take people calling her Khaleesi over the ones hat just call her \u201cthe mother of dragons\u201d
\"the dragon lady\"
It's not Khaleesi, it's Kelly C. Kelly Crazy.
so many poor little girls are named after a genocidal maniac
oh shit
Fair enough. I wish you good fortune in the gatekeeping to come.
Night gathers, and now my watch begins.
No, but to dismiss those people as not real fans, or to say \"they probably can't name five people\" is a bit ridiculous. I have a friend who is in love with the show, novels, etc. She knows all the characters, houses, mottos, stories, etc. And she LOVED this last season. Like, she understood the criticism and clearly saw that it was a bit rushed, but she would agree 100% with the people that say this season was \"Amazing\" or \"Satisfying\".
Jon wasn't sent to the Night's Watch to protect the Kingdom from wildlings or the NK.  It was an exile.  That was just a convenient place to exile him instead of Essos like Jorah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey didn't let Tyrion pick the king.  He nominated a king, pled his case, and the others agreed, for varying reasons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBran suffers from the same thing Dr. Strange suffered in Infinity War.  If you know how something plays out, you can't tell everyone or else it changes.  Like I said, D&D had a tough time explaining that, so they jumped a bit and excluded conversations...namely the Bran and Tyrion at Winterfell.  I can accept that they might have discussed this outcome, but you don't have to.  Bran will be the king in GRRM's book as well, so he might explain it, or he might never finish it because he can't either.  As I said, I understand it doesn't perfectly follow a logical progression, but there's enough there that I'm okay, knowing that they probably couldn't explain it neatly.  They didn't need to throw in a \"I saw 14,000,065 timelines and there was onle 1 we won\" line for me to accept it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat powers do you think Bran has gained?  He can see the past and the future, but it's not clear how much he is allowed to change them.  Time travel is tricky, and some amount of fans will always complain about it.  They're targeting Bran because he is the history of man.  They said it in the show.  You can accept that as their motive, or you can believe they have another motive that wasn't mentioned.  We don't need these mythical white walkers completely fleshed out.  We are mostly seeing them from the humans perspective.  They don't know everything about the white walkers, and since they don't know, us viewers don't.  We aren't seeing the show from the POV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think taking another person's face is as easy as killing them and removing it to wear.  There's some magic involved which requires body preperation like in the House of Black and White.  Let's not pretend that it would be a satisfying ending for the story if Arya just donned some faces and assassinated Cersei, Dany, whoever.  Based on the polls, people on this sub don't like Arya having this much influence on the show already, so what would giving her that many big kills do to stop the complaints.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I said, the story wasn't perfect, but you're pointing at all the flaws, big and small, that weren't criticized in seasons past.  Rewatch them and you'll find just as many inconsistencies or stories that just don't make total sense.
> They didn't let Tyrion pick the king. He nominated a king, pled his case, and the others agreed, for varying reasons.\n\nHandwaving away the motivations of the lord of six kingdoms as \"varying reasons\" is exactly what was wrong with the ending. The show is called Game of Thrones, FFS, and the game ended by three/four unfleshed characters aye-ing away their rights to become vassals of a random northerner without a claim to the throne.\n\nNo royal marriages, no scheming, no alliances, no promises, no compromises - just \"yup\".
Except Dr. Strange can see multiple possibilities whereas its not know what Bran sees, but its still morally disgusting. If Bran had acted who is to say the future afterwards would lead to a disasterous future???\n\nNow his king and he conveinently will now only change the future?
Sounds like he just bingewatched for the plot and not the universe. Pretty sad, but understandable.
That\u2019s kind of hilarious because it really does highlight people\u2019s hypocrisy.
There's no more Lannisters though. He's the warden of his own kingdom now.
But everyone is declaring indepence(well, at least they will after the King just let's his sister declares the largest kingdom to be independent) \n\nIt isn't the choice of lannisters or sansa\n\nIts the choice of sansa, Bran, or independence
\"UNPOPULAR OPINION, I liked it\" x100 gold
> This isn't just book readers nitpicking about their favorite theories not coming to fruition.\n\nYet this will be repeated ad nauseum by people who love to strawman criticism.
lol thanks! We kept putting off the show for years, despite all our friends saying we needed to watch it. So we said we'd watch 3 episodes and if we didn't like it, then we'd stop. \n\nWell, we never stopped
There really aren't meaningful discussions, there front page is essentially them hating on freefolk, mocking criticism and overall just circlejerking. \n\nThey reference a poll that interviewed 495 people and state that because 50% of thosd people enjoyed the season \"most\" people enjoyed the season. They honestly think 495 peoplr can speak for 20 million.\n\nThey also hate any criticism unless you overly blazt the season with compliments, every demoted commented is someone just criticising the show. Honestly, they are literally circlejerkimg and continuously have idiotic discussions on how S8 was so good, and if you try to explain that it was rushed - they dont care and downvote you.\n\nThat sub is by far the opposite of meaningful discussions, if you sift through free folk they have better discussions and on this subreddit. Contrary to popular belief those subs don't just have blind hate (the memes sometimes target nuance mistakes) and if you scroll down you can actually see criticism is downvoted for not being logical and manchildrrn comments are down there.
I can't agree with this, many people on /r/asoaifcirclejerk state in the comments that the season was rushed and mention specific things they didn't like about it, and I don't really see these points contested much there.  I also don't really see a lot of statements that the season was \"brilliant\" or \"best ever\".\n\nAs I see it, three things are being contested:\n\n1. the \"consensus\" that S8 was bad, that doesn't exist; the viewership is split on the issue.\n\n2. the notion that anyone who liked S8 must be an idiot (I have gotten replies to this effect myself here).\n\n3. various \"gaps in logic\" arguements being themselves illogical or ignoring previous parts of the show.
> you'd much rather have someone that the public loves be the final winner.\n\nNot necessarily, I just want an interesting character. If a character is interesting some people will want to see them win even if they're not widely popular. But for almost nobody to be interested in Bran is damning and shows what a terrible job D&D have done with the character. I'd have taken someone who was hated like Littlefinger or Ramsay over Bran any day.
Hell I thought Cersei was gonna wind up on the throne back in season 6. That would\u2019ve been much more interesting.
Oh, I concur, it's just the wheel thing itself was never really developed beyond it being said as a grand idea. But it was never really defined, nor how it would be changed.\n\nNot that I think a Grand Council couldn't break out into war/violence, but likely it may be better for the small folk.
i'm very confused
the wire, the sopranos, true detective season 1, breaking bad.\n\nwhy do you assume i hate everything. i just hate this show because i once loved it, and the reason for it being bad (or at least worse than before) are completely OBJECTIVE.
> the wire, the sopranos, true detective season 1, breaking bad.\n\nSorry, nope, those aren't good. You must be mentally challenged to like them. I would know, I don't like them, and therefore I'm mentally superior to you.
Practice makes perfect.
i think the point is more that it\u2019s really tiring being someone here who still enjoys the show, because saying that is like calling a lynch mob to your front door. \n\ncase in point: someone says they like the show and you come back with a snide remark. why are you so insecure that you need an echo chamber to validate your opinion? why can\u2019t people just say they like the show?
Yes, thank you :)
It is. They just wanted to bring some fake tension into the winterfell scenes and failed miserably
How about when he was led out as a prisoner to face judgement and everyone\u2019s like so Tyrion who should be king?
You're nuts.
Anything with a brain could do better than D&D for the writing. He isnt nuts
They deus ex-ed every major plot point in the story. 0 telegraphing, very little sense in the outcome.\n\nHowever they get points for style cinematography and artistry.\n\nYou know all the things that make them great to adopt source material into tv. Only problem is.. source ran out ...
Just like GRRM said, he developed his characters well, too well in fact that they all have their own personalities and he writes based on what their personalities act upon. \n\nThat's all D&D had to do. They written material that goes way outside of the character's personalities.
> I think that's implied pretty heavily with the dragon vision over King's Landing back season 6 or whatever it was.\n\nUnlikely since they didn't come up with many of these twists until after they shot season 6.
> The only person that D+D actually gave a good story arch is Theon. \n\nPartially because his story arc is almost complete in the books. We have yet to see the end, of course, but it doesn't take any more build up to reap the rewards which is the only new bit they tacked on.
So...weird lip service?  \"I don't want to be king, you know it because I said so, even though I appear to have done everything in my power to make myself king.  Also I said I can't be a lord and that I'm not Bran a couple of episodes ago, but now I'm Bran and I can be a king.
Most likely, however it\u2019s the writing that is the problem here. It\u2019s the way they got there not the actual ending that\u2019s the problem.
I mean, I'm sure GRRM also told them to try and least justify/show his deeper moments rather than some dead pan character
I'm not even sure Bran is alive in the show. It called itself the 3ER and kept saying it isn't human and showed no emotion at being reunited with its \"relatives\" so is there anything of Bran left in there? Is it just a flesh puppet warged into by a dying Brynden Rivers with access to Bran's memories? Is the 3ER some psychic parasite that's been jumping from host to host for longer than the Night King has existed and it finally gamed the humans into killing its only real threats *and* put itself in position to control them in one fell swoop?\n\nAnyway, I am sure we got the real endings for Dany, Sansa and Jon. Not so sure the same is true of the other characters and Bran, at the very least, must have a very different path since, as far as we know, there isn't even a Night King in the books.
There has been zero implication that the \"Three Eyed Raven,\" poorly explained concept as it is, was ever some force destined to be king.  The last one spent a century sitting in a cave.  Also \"I'm the Three Eyed Raven, I can't be lord of anything\" doesn't really jive with this.\n\n\nIf they want the entire plot to hinge on Bran's ascendance, maybe take two fucking seconds to make him a character, explain what he is or provide him with some motivation.
Actually, no. I\u2019m calling D&D terrible writers. They completely botched Bran\u2019s story line and character arch, which was devoid of any meaningful content the last two seasons. The problem is not that Bran became king, which I agree is likely GRRM\u2019s intention as well, the problem is how D&D got him to this point.
Yeah, he could be a little more human to Meera if he is capable of joking, thanking and ruling.
Ah another series that ended to poor writing; alad the Dexter series....
An entire team of people didn\u2019t see the discrepancy there. Tbh I feel it was an intentional misdirect and they hoped we\u2019d be too dumb to notice
Just saying that the old gods wanted him to would have sufficed, because they wanted to restore their dominion through Bran. It would have explained some.
LOL \n\nWe kinda forgot about the Old Gods - D&D probably
I think D&D literally *accidently* wrote a seriously sinister line without even realizing it
They subverted themselves.
Same...like he\u2019s a cripple and came all this way from Winterfell...he\u2019s never even been south of Winterfell in his life before.
He's the Three-Eyed Raven he's been fucking everywhere
Yeah all that went nowhere, they just dumped the fantasy aspects
Biggest letdown because that was my personal favourite part. I was dying to find out more about the NK, or the Gods, or the magic that brought back the dragons, or anything magically really. \n\nI feel like we learned nothing new about anything magical between S7-S8 when I thought that would be the most informative part.
They're leaving it for the prequels.
Ugh that would be even worse. Elaborating on WW lore despite the viewers having the knowledge that that whole plot is just belly shanked out of existence.
The *only* logical conclusion based on everything we saw is that the 3ER is an evil mastermind. If that is not what was intended, it speaks volumes about how badly the writing failed this season.
I think that's the only conclusion if you determine that the 3ER was in control of everything, but why do we think that? It seems possible that he was navigating events that he could foresee but couldn't control.
 *never remotely explained or developed upon* \n\nJust like Bran! It all fits together, see?
The fact that he gave Arya the dagger and only ever seemed to be interested in making sure Jon knew his lineage so he could have a falling out with Dany is evidence he was manipulating things. It is extremely unclear why he cared to wait for Jaime in the courtyard though as Jaime was relatively irrelevant.
The dagger is a massive stretch. It\u2019s never acknowledged whatsoever that Bran knows the future. It was pointless for Bran to keep the dagger. As for Jon - Jon\u2019s lineage is never mentioned by Jon or Dany after 8.02. His lineage only caused Varys\u2019 betrayal. His lineage had nothing to do with their falling out, that was all because of Dany committing genocide
No of course there isn't, but that's why I loved the finale so much; everything is open for interpretation.\n\nI do think that line was all they needed to throw in there to get the gears turning in peoples heads. They did what they could with 6 episodes.
Lol fair enough I guess.
I think Bran as depicted in this final episode is nothing more than an object in Tyrion's arc. He is elected because of some weird speech by Tyrion and is then shown to be completely uninterested in doing anything as King as Tyrion leads the small council meeting. Tyrion is essentially king at the end and is finally trying to do a good job and care about everyone or w/e. Bran became king because he is an emotionless husk who is useless and won't do anything selfish. However, I prefer an evil 3ER interpretation.
That\u2019s a fair argument. Still doesn\u2019t explain why anyone outside of Sansa and arguably Tyrion (who wasn\u2019t supposed to have power in that scene) want Bran as king.  \n\nSweet Robin would\u2019ve made about as much sense for king
His first action as the King: Bran says \"perhaps I can find him\" Find him for what? Maybe control him? Im 100% sure he is the true villain. And any writer worth anything would see that that's what you just set up :P
He does not imply that he was manipulating the events, only that he is a part of them. He has always and repeatedly said that everyone *has* to play their part, not that the part can be changed or manipulated. He has a purely deterministic view of the world.\n\nWhat he meant was \"I find myself here in front of you at this particular moment and not somewhere else because this is what has to happen\".  There is no free will, just a fulfilment of something that is predetermined.\n\nThis is the way Bran has behaved and spoken since he became the 3ER, only acknowledging that events have to happen the way they are set up to happen, and not differently.
And the predetermined worldview you describe only happens through characters and plotlines acting in utterly unrealistic and absurd ways
He has Wisdom.
Or you'd think he could have warged into drogon to stop dany
that's too petty a title for the 3ER. Nothing below King for him.
He obviously isn't, seeing as Jon is. However, there's no way to tell from the data in this poll what the distribution of people's second-favorites looks like (this being the distribution of first-favorites). Sure, Bran probably isn't the most common second-favorite, but given the questiom asked in this poll we can't know for sure.
I think it\u2019s safe to presume you picked the least important part of my comment.
Wait. No. Jon meant say \"I don't want it\"
Eyyy dun waahhnnt eet
DO Daenerys know da way?
Seriously, as if that was her first child.
As if she hadn\u2019t already pushed one of her children to suicide.
Characters forgetting things is the central theme of season 8.
Exactly; you'd think he'd realize by now that she didn't care for anyone ezcept for power.
Cersei only loves herself.
I mean...that's blatantly wrong. She clearly loves her children. She's just a psychopath about it.
They aren't its just a border town now.
Pretty sure there is no nights watch...the entire castle black is full of wildlings you don't see any crows. \n\nIt was just the players in the 7 kingdoms pulling a fast one on an outsider (Greyworm)
The realms of men.
There was no night watch at the castle. He ran off with the free folk. Hopefully he will use his leverage withbthe monarchs of the north and south to broker good trade deals for the wildlings .
Shadow cats, ice spiders, dire wolves. Pretty much stuff that was never mentioned in the show
The NK will rise again, and so will the white walkers.
I don't think the children would make the same mistake twice.
Winter is coming.\n\nThe most *chilling* of house words because it\u2019s always true, and now has a very permanent double meaning that they didn\u2019t realize was a reality. \n\nUntil the next generation \u201coh they\u2019re all dead you\u2019re crazy/no such thing. And the cycle repeats, but the north remembers
Snarks obviously.

No it was beyond the wall. You see the same arrowheadshaped mountain in the background as we saw in season 7 ep 6 \"beyond the wall\"
No it doesnt... it doesnt imply that she was right, just that she couldnt be stopped properly until after it (maybe killing her beforehand wouldve brought her armies\u2019 wrath to a larger portion of westeros and thus killing way more people)
I think he's trying to say her killing the city was the only way to get her followers to see the truth about her. (Mainly Jon and Tyrion). And once they saw the truth then they took action. I think it's telling that the Dragon and the Unsullied didn't kill Jon outright. I think that kind of shows that even they knew deep down that Dany crossed a line. That she had to cross the line so people could see the truth. Otherwise she would have stayed queen and the endless wars would have continued with deaths piling up but in small enough piles that you never realized the body count was so high until it's too late.
But why tho, I can see Bran being the bad guy but that would be really boring, you can literally find an extra, have him kill a bee and he would have more background as a villain than Bran\n\n\nI don't know, it sounds like D&D had no idea what to do with Bran so they just let him be a bystander that acts like a god and let the fans write a good theory\n\n\n[GRRM's thoughts about characters that turn out like Bran]( https://grrm.livejournal.com/82239.html)\n\n\nIMO this will be GRRM ending too but it will actually make a lot more sense, D&D just kinda took the idea and didn't even try to explain why
I think, if this happens in the books, it'll have quite a bit of creepier undertones. Bran's tutelage in the books is practically eldritch in its atmosphere, and Bran himself has been doing increasingly questionable, agency-ignoring things.
I don't think D&D knew why, so we don't know why. \n\nHere's hoping GRRM rocks it!
Sean Bean was 006 was he not? He didn't play James Bond.
Oh! My reading comprehension must have been non-existent when I posted that. I thought that they were saying they wanted Bean to be the next 007. \n\nRe-reading it now, I just definitely misread.
I would too, if I\u2019m getting paid.
Bran wasn't just worried. We saw the NK kill the other TER, and we saw him about to kill Bran. It's pretty obvious he isn't immortal.
Did the look on Bran\u2019s dopey ass face look worried?\n\nI agree with you that he isn\u2019t immortal, but I really don\u2019t think it matters to the story at all. After cameras started filming this season the writers made it clear that they don\u2019t give a fuck what happens after the cameras stopped.
OK, I'll concede yes, the TER is immortal in the sense that he can pass his consciousness on to another living person. This is what the old TER did as soon as he knew the NK would be coming for Bran. Bran never went through a similar process of passing on his knowledge to another person, so there was a very real chance he was going to die, and not be able to pass on his consciousness, and therefore not be immortal.
>think It was a good ending. It was just executed absolutely terribly.\n\nSo not a good ending.
For example danys arc is unreal did she go insane or did she make a conscious decision to rule with fear and tyranny. The show made it seem like a little of both. Makes no sense it\u2019s one or the other. Martin will clear that up for us.
Because a lot doesn\u2019t make sense.. but if you\u2019re a book reader you should have enough information to understand the ending. Martin will answer all our questions when he finishes his books. The show ending is his ending
Because she would have plunged the world into darkness with her tyranny. Duh
\ud83e\udd14
They weren't cool with the Boltons either, but wouldn't join the fight against them. Also the Boltons would be in power. \n\nThe NK did find a way to win anyway, and he died cause Arya is sneaky. \n\nRobb being king in the north did pay off. The red wedding is the payoff of that plot line. It doesn't need to be positive payoff to be payoff.
Strawman. You said dragons bond with one rider. Drogon clearly bonded with jon multiple times. They also bonded with tyrion in the crypts though you could argue that was just because they were chained up and wanted to be free
They didn't bond with Jon, they just looked at him. Dragons have one rider and they have killed other Targaryen such as during the civil war.\n\nDo you know what a strawman is?
No, in the books it's clear she was never trying to heal him. She is very strict about not removing the salve because it's actually a poison and abrasive enough that he would want to remove it. She ensures his death by convincing Dany it's going to heal him, then takes her son and any future children from her.
Yes it may not kill you near-instantaneously like the heart but if the bowels are lacerated death is still highly likely. They are highly vascular organs and the internal bleeding would have been massive and unstoppable without doing surgery. And it's not just infection risk as with any other wound. Bowel perforations leak bacteria laden fecal matter into the abdominal cavity\u2014it's a whole other level of fulminant infection.
It's complex, but it's significantly less complex than the books. Considering that, in an ideal world, they'd have to redo seasons 7 and 8, by the end of seasons 6, major characters that need resolution and/or converging are:\n\nDaenerys/Tyrion/Varys, Jon/Sansa, Littlefinger, Arya, Bran, Yara/Theon, Jaime, Euron and Cersei\n\nThe trickiest one is Littlefinger, and Arya considering what they did to her in season 6. It's perfectly doable with any amount of effort, and that's the thing: there was no effort. People have been throwing around the idea that D&D suck balls, but there's plenty of fantastic show-only scenes written by them.\n\nThey *can* write, they just were too lazy and uninterested these two last seasons. Which is probably even worse.\n\nAnd it might not be generic fantasy, but it's still a fantasy story. The ending didn't need to be \"holy shit, that was insane!\", it just needed to be satisfying I find. \"Bran drove Aerys mad by whispering 'Burn them all' into his ear\" would've been \"crazy\" enough I find, and then just finish your character's arcs in a way that makes sense.
I honestly thought Arya was great until she reached the faceless men, at which point her entire arc just becomes nonsense.\n\nIt's like the story bends itself backwards trying to make her cool, to the point where she just becomes a Mary Sue to me. Like the faceless men become incredibly inconsistent and nonsensical to justify her breaking away, and then her character basically just becomes Smug. Like what was the point of taking faces if she uses it once to kill an entire family (who knows if any of them are innocent) and never again.\n\nBeforehand she made sense and was a fun character who played off well with other characters, the show added Tywin and Arya stuff is a highlight, afterwards she's a complete mess and really being a character to me, which is a consistent issue in later series (looking at you robot Bran).
Blah blah blah yeah, if you were genuinely enthralled by Arya\u2019s beef with the Waif come in immediately for some brain testing, I feel like we could make huge breakthroughs in entertainment if we got a look inside your mind
Yeah, no, that's not how writing works. If you spend 6 seasons building up some supernatural existential threat, the catalyst for that threat becoming *an actual threat* can't be \"the main characters decide to not do nothing\". Had Jon *literally just fucking stayed dead*, then the Long Night either never happens or it happens in a way that uh...makes sense. That doesn't make his arc significant, it makes it pointless. No one has to unite, because the NK is a joke who can get murdered by some rando faceless man, and since the horn of winter doesn't exist in the show, he has no way past the wall without Jon going up there to begin with. If Jon does nothing or just stays dead, the arc doesn't happen. That's not to say you cant have the plot be about the protagonists cleaning up a mess they caused, and an antagonist they made/empowered/released, but that's not what happened. The WWs have been advertised as the real threat since the first episode of the first season. But they weren't. They were a nonfactor; the world didn't need to unite to beat them, as we see by Cersei sitting the entire thing out and only \"half\" of Dany's forces dying despite that, and that's *with the dragon the Walkers had that they wouldn't have had otherwise*.\n\nAlso thinking named characters dying means anything lmao. Hey guys, Lommy and mandon moore died! Oh no! They're named characters so that matters, right?\n\nThe Battle of Winterfell was narratively pointless, Dany is shown being able to demolish KL with *only* Drogon, the NK was never a real threat, no one important dies, I could go on forever.\n\nYou're the one reducing it to \"ur mad Jon didn't stab him\"\n\nNo, I'm mad he didn't destroy fucking anything despite being hyped up the entire show. Ramsay was more formidable than that chump lmao.
And if Ned hadn't told Cersei he knew about the incest, then he wouldn't have died and none of books 2-3 would have happened. And if Robb hadn't married Jeyne Poole/Talisa or sent Theon to the Iron Islands, the Red Wedding wouldn't have happened. Protagonists' mistakes causing their problems is a common trope in this story and in \"writing\" (lol at \"that's not how writing works,\" as if there's one guide to writing fiction that you just need to follow). \n\nNow, I agree that there are problems with the Beyond the Wall plotline. If the only way the night king gets beyond the wall is a dragon, and the only way he gets a dragon is by sheer dumb luck, that makes him a less interesting villain. I also wish more of the supernatural aspects and their fallout had been addressed before or after the battle.  I think The Long Night would have been more powerful of more characters died, and I wish many characters did more significant things in the episode itself, Jon included, to create more of a climactic feel. But let's not exaggerate. More characters do die in this episode than any other battle of the series, and among them are very significant characters like Jorah and Theon, not Lommie. The fallout from the battle affects the plot, driving Dany's rage and failed messiah complex, leading to the Bells. Jon is still the one who united half of Westeros and who gets credit (along with Arya) for winning the battle, causing Dany to feel more isolated and unloved in Westeros, leading \nto all that happens in the second half of the season. \n\nMeanwhile, claiming character arcs are pointless because a character doesn't destroy anything (in a glorious way, presumably? Because Jon does kill Dany) shows at least a massive oversimplification of what the term \"character arc\" means.
Yeah I straight up would have been more satisfied with Gendry. He was always somewhere on the list of possible contenders, while Bran was annoyingly out of nowhere.
tbh if they had a few more seems of him being explicitly heroic that could have been a VERY good twist.
I actually forgot about that. He sort of disappeared after that whole thing. These people should have been at least brought up.
He's even part Targaryen!
D&D kinda forgot about what they wrote in Episode 5
I feel like this has always been her story arc though. She always claims to be good and tries to do the right thing, but the second someone stands between her and her ambition she lashes out. Maybe it's me, but I feel like this is one thing that's always been in the series. The question if she's going to be as crazy as her ancestors or if she will rise above it.\n\nI mean, do you remember when she crucified the Masters? That was brutal and not exactly the only option available to her. She's always had that in her and this was a constant pattern within the series with Tyrion trying to temper her. I agree that this was a step further, but it didn't feel entirely out of character to me.
I apologize if it seems like I was trying to argue that it would not happen, I am trying to argue it was too fast. \n\nFor me, after hearing the bells, she should have taken off and destroyed the castle anyways. Which would be in character because of the brutality toward her enemies. Then once she has taken over, there is some unrest because of her destruction of the keep and the dothraki doing dothraki things. To stop the unrest she executes some civilians. Then more unrest. More executions. Until finally jon has to kill her. \n\nSomething that would really allow us to see that ultimate power push her over the edge. Instead of getting emotional on a dragon one day, torching a city and becoming hitler.\n\nIdk, that is just my opinion.
Objective means in my opinion right?
People are allowed to be fans of Hitler as well. It doesn't make what he did right.
>People are allowed to be fans of Hitler as well. \n\nI always knew there was something wrong about this place.  This sub has gone bonkers.
Didn't realise writing Game of Thrones was equivalent to genocide
Lady, I think you forgot your hormone pills.
To be fair they\u2019ll probably adapt one of the legend stories like knights of the old republic or something
Thats fucking lame, holy shit thats lame. People are expecting new stories not old rehashed ones.
Lmao I know right
That dialogue is too intelligent for current Tyrion.
That's also when they still had support of high garden and dorne as well \ud83e\udd14 good thinking on tyrion's part to save bloodshed...
Quick fix, Euron is Yara's (and Theon's) uncle.
And he got rewarded in the end.
I find this one of the most upsetting things. Danys downfall was tyrion stulid abd her blindly trusting him. You accept a few mistakes such as taking casterly rock wheb the army took highgarden however to have it done consistebtly by a character we know to be one of the most intelligent characters in the kingdom just to fit thw plot you lose the suspension of disbelief
she didn't have to.  just burn the keep.  or just sit there with the dragons intimidating as fuck, and watch everyone throw down their weapons and offer her cersei's head.
i don't think the keep housed just lannisters and she hadn't really demonstrated how powerful dragons are at that point. i do agree that it doesn't make a ton of sense and did say as much in my first comment but i just think the decision is kinda in line with dany's goals at the time.
Umm Dany doesn\u2019t even know about the NK till 7.06. In 7.01 there was literally zero reason she doesn\u2019t just show up at KL with her fucking laughably enormous army and three nuclear weapons.
So there are more than 2 situations here. She could still have taken King\u2019s Landing without burning all the women and children. After seeing the power that 1 dragon has then 3 dragons would be more than enough to win a war with the Lannister\u2019s. Just by intimidation if anything. Unless you think the only way to win a war is by killing everyone associated with the other side (total war) then she could have done that too. And she didn\u2019t think Cersei was going to help with the dead until the last episode of season 7. It had nothing to do with her motivations in the beginning of season 7
i mean i agree that it doesn't make sense considering how fucking strong drogon was in 8.05 but like i said, i don't think it's anywhere near the worst offender and not burning down the city or even the red keep is kinda in line with her motivations of taking the city without a loss of innocnet life as i'm pretty sure that even the red keep doesn't house just lannisters. honestly though i think a lot of people who write sci-fi or fantasy fuck up when they introduce some super powerful weapon that only one side has and then try to somehow portray it as a somewhat even fight.
The nightking having a dragon was fine. The dragon being his ticket to pass the wall was disapointing as hell ( but also predictible the moment he got the dragon)
[removed]
Like I said, grow up
I put 2 because the actors and realisation were good. But the writing is probably the shitest i ever saw.\nI spent half this last episode laughing in disbelief honeslty
Like I said if you factor in the rest of the show   and all the other impacts of this episode yeah I could believe someone giving it a 1.  Just like I can see someone who just wants to watch a big spectacle giving it a 10
I can honestly say there was no other episode of tv from other shows that I've seen that made me more disappointed or angry.  and most of this season has writing as bad as I've ever seen anywhere.
Then you don\u2019t watch enough TV....
They get more high fantasy as they go along. GRRM wanted to sorta do the opposite of Tolkien;instead of startibg with lots of magic and show it slowly fade away, he started low magic and slowly introduces more and more of it into the world.
magic is still negligible and mostly irrelevant, but most high fantasy centers around magic
The high fantasy elements really start up after book one with the birthing of dragons. Especially for characters in Essos. Still not as high fantasy as something like wheel of time.
sure. she's just the leader of a nation, she wouldn't know anything about something major like that.
Well Dany literally forgot a major part of her enemy's forces so nothing is out of the ordinary if Yara wasn't told Ayra killed the NK
Oh, but the NK wouldn't die in Winterfell if I had any say on it. I'd make them win the Battle of Winterfell, then the living keep retreating south all the way to King's Landing, where they make their last stand.
I mean they didn\u2019t even really have fight scenes early on. but now we have entire episodes dedicated to it. Like the battle where jamie got kidnapped.... they legit didn\u2019t even show it. they just showed what happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAPLiWPgLUQ\n\nThese are all better than anything we got in Season 8. Except for like dragon CGI stuff
Ugh even worse
The answer to your last line is they're tired of war.  If you want me to break it down how I interpreted it, I can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdmure- Riverlands.  He was a prisoner for years, was shut down by his niece when he was trying to nominate himself.  He lost the castle his uncle took, accepted his nephew's nomination.  Not really that objectionable for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSam- Reach.  He is best friends with Bran's brother.  He knows a bit about Bran's powers.  Thinks Bran might rule well with great knowledge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyrion- Westerlands.  Nominated Bran, obviously has great respect for him.  Thinks he will serve the realm well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGendry- Stormlands.  Newly appointed lord, presumably knows very little.  He loves the king's sister, has respect for his brother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRobin- Vale.  Yohn Royce gave him the look to agree.  Bran's cousin presumably on decent terms.  I'm unsure of how much Royce has filled him in, but he probably thinks Bran will be a fair ruler, as the Vale and North have been close since S6.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrince of Dorne.  I don't know about this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYara- Iron Islands.  She probably does not want Bran to be king.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDavos.  Holds the Stark family in high regard.  He's just looking for a fair and just ruler, no reason to think he doesn't think Bran will be that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome people might have enjoyed it, or wanted it, but we didn't need two more seasons of Gendry learning how to be a high lord.  We don't need to see the mess of a political situation that is Dorne, considering everyone very vocally hated it in S5.  With the rest, most are related to Bran, or hold his brother in high regard.  They have no reason to fight over this and potentially continue the war.  It's not a random northerner.  He is the last living son of Eddard Stark, warden of the north.  Prior to his death, Varys had been sending ravens all over.  We can assume he had relayed the events at Winterfell.  People know Bran's story.
i mean i hate to break it to you but you're not being clever at all, you're not actually arguing against anything i've said you're just screeching over my choice of words. shame you can't counter my point. i was hoping you'd ask how GoT is objectively bad but you still haven't.
Twice you accused people who liked this season as being borderline mentally challenged. You aren't arguing with any shred of integrity, so you certainly don't derserve my time or anything that isn't me throwing your insulting nonargument right back in your face.
OK...physically...
Well for one the 3ER is a spiritual entity that passes from host to host and is thousands of years old. It can also see the future, which is shown by the visions Bran has. It also basically took actions such as revealing jons heritage for no reason other than to cause kings landing to be massacred and himself to become king. There was no other result from that action. \n\nSo he's basically worse than Dany because he doesnt care about 1 million people being slaughtered while being completely sane, has total surveillance over everyone, and will be king for at least 1000 years in brans body, potentially forever if he swaps host and makes the new host king.
Yeah, I can see that. I think you got it right with the \"writing failed\" comment, though. I don't think we were supposed to take this grim analysis away from the show. I think painting it this way is just indicative of how much season 8 collapsed. And I think it's stuff like this that is making it difficult for George to finish the books himself.
Jon stops fucking Dany because of his lineage, that is the true problem it causes. The show unintentionally makes Dany not getting fucked by Jon anymore one of the biggest motivating factors of her madness. \n\nBut yea also nothing about Bran is acknowledged. He's the greatest war asset of all time and he does nothing to help. The fact that he gave the weapon that killed the Night King to the person that killed the Night King is certainly relevant.
I think it was more about her desperate loneliness than Jon himself. But I agree, they set up the scene as the specific moment that Dany\u2019s madness is locked into place. And the trigger is Jon\u2019s rejection of her advances. \n\nIt would have been cool if Dany\u2019s entire character arc wasn\u2019t derailed in a ten-seconds telenovela scene.
Bran sees the future in visions: he sees a dragon over kings landing; eventually that does happen and it turns out to be Drogon burning Kings Landing.
I understand why so many people are complaining, but it's typically the same reason across the board: \"it was rushed and things weren't explained.\" Sure, there were some dumb moments, but that's the main complaint.\n\nWith the few episodes they had, I think they did a great job and I'm fine with having to come up with some of my own ideas to fill in the blanks until the books come out.\n\nI like being left wondering a bit mixed with the relatively happy ending that we got.
[deleted]
Tyrion convincing anyone that Bran is the best King didn't make any sense at all. Elective Monarchy? Sure makes sense after the last two Heirs eliminated themself as candidates just now.  But why the youngest Stark who doesn't even speak?\n\nBtw where has Dorne been all the time and why are they now suddenly interested in who becomes King again? And why do they agree with Bran who they probably didn't even know existed.
Bran is totes a villain and people are just unable to accept it.
This has nothing to do with him being or not being able to see the future and manipulate events to change it.
Umm no you\u2019re arguing Bran merely lets things play out in a predetermined way. My argument is two-fold 1) This is barely alluded to whatsoever outside of two throw away lines. 2) If your argument is correct it is only correct because other characters have been made to act in outlandish and ridiculous ways
I thought the entire point of Hodor is their world isn't predetermined and could be changed and manipulated. There is something sinister about the way he asked Sam to tell truth and told that is the right time and also all the staring he had on Tyrion throughout the season.
I don't think the children can make the same mistake again.
Well, now that the knowledge of how WhiteWalkers are created is out there, this would be the set-up for a sequel series where some evil guy births a new Night King.\n\nOfcourse, I think Bran is the only one who knows so he'd have to have told Tyrion or somebody.
KL had mountains around it and it changed in the last seasons, you can't really use that as an evidence, they apparently have the technology to move around mountains in westeros.
It was literally the exact same mountain. There would simply not be a single reason to use the exact same mountain for different purposes. https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-579d1ac34cfc1b12153f8afa8f100fc6
It\u2019s all good, I can see how you read it that way
Yeah, but if it leaves people so confused its not a good ending. The execution also matters, not just the plot.
> I was able to make sense of It all and think It was a good ending\n\n.\n\n> Because a lot doesn\u2019t make sense..\n\nchoose one
Directly after watching It, I was very confused but then after thinking about It and taking into consideration the information from the books, I was able to connect the dots of how martin would finish the books with the ending from\nthe show. \n\nFor anyone who didn\u2019t read any of the books, they would never understand wtf happened this past season. Only with supporting info from the books can you kinda understand these characters motives and guess some things.
Lmao whatever. It was clearly meant as a bonding moment. Drogon was interested in jon and let him pet him. Then they showed dany intrigued at deogon doing that cause he never had before. You can tell it helped her her start loving jon the way she looked at him then. Cause she knew he was special for drogon to like him. Did you not even watch the scene lol.\n\nThen rhaegal bonded with jon by letting him ride him and pet him. How is a dragon letting you ride him not bonding lmao.\n\nSo there are at least three instances of dragons bonding with more than one person.\n\nYes i know what a strawman is. Its what you just did. i am solely talking about your comment regarding dragons bonding with only one rider which has been shown to be objectively false.\n\nI am well aware dragons have killed targaryens and of the civil war.
>then he wouldn't have died and none of books 2-3 would have happened\n\nUh, you sure about that buddy? I'm pretty sure Robert still dies, Joffrey still ascends, and Stannis still finds out he's the rightful heir. So uh...yeah no, the plot still happens. It definitely happens differently, but it still happens.\n\nThe plot doesn't happen if Jon just doesn't go north of the wall. We don't have to extrapolate with your example; we *know* Robert's death and Stannis taking up arms are independent of Ned's decision to tell Cersei he knows about the incest. But we *do* have to invent a way for the army of the dead to get beyond the wall, because the show never gives us one. They do it with Viserion. And Viserion remains their best weapon, since without him, only the NK himself and the...wind, are stopping all 3 dragons from just toasting everything even *if* they magically get over the wall and down to winterfell.\n\nSo uh, no. Also lol at the deaths. As for the fallout, you're right...sorta...but the fallout has nothing to do with a *battle*. As we see in episode 5, all of Dany;s setbacks were meaningless. Drogon can solo King's Landing. The end. None of the past 2 seasons affects her conquest in a meaningful way, and thus the WWs are reduced to a plot device to kill Jorah, while the rest of her woes with Cersei/Euron only happen to get Missandei killed, as together it robs her of advisors. *That's fucking it*. She can take KL with one dragon, which is what she should have done a season ago. Also, there's no justification for ep5 anyway, her turn towards genocidal Hitler comes out of nowhere, advisors or no, so if you're actually daft enough to try and defend that hilariously bad writing then you're a lost cause. As I've said a few other places, the fact that Anakin's turn to the dark side (which goes from conflicted but still on the side of the law to child murder in ~15m of screen time) is being cited as a heel turn executed *better* than Daenerys says everything about how much of an utter failure her transition to a morally black bad guy is.
> Which would be in character because of the brutality toward her enemies.\n\nHer enemies were the people of KL themselves, as she directly stated in dialogue that very episode. She knew from the moment word got out about Jon, that her fight to win the throne was no longer exclusively against Cersei. Removing Cersei was now only one obstacle. She knew she needed the rest of the country, the smallfolk and lords that would renounce support for her and stand behind Jon, to fear her completely. If she had only taken out military targets, it wouldn't send the same message. If the people hear of half a million burning alive in KL, they would be more inclined to hesitate in supporting a force against her, because she won't just destroy the army you send, she will burn you and your family down in your home.\n\n\nShe knew the battle needed to not just be won, but be won *a certain way*. She *needed* to take out Cersei *with maximum collateral damage* to send that message. She never thought a surrender would be sounded, so she would have a marketable excuse for why the battle \"had to continue\" until her enemy was defeated, and that she was willing to kill half a million to complete her objective, again, sending the message that noncombatants that don't support her aren't safe.\n\n\nWhen the bells were rung, she knew she would lose the throne then and there if the battle ended right away. Not a loss to Cersei, but a loss to the people of the 7 Kingdoms, who would rise against her and her inferior claim. She had to either give up right then and there on achieving the throne, or kill the people anyway to serve her ambition. The choice to serve her ambition to the detriment of others is one she has made numerous times in the past.
Her enemies were Cersei, Euron, The Mountain, The Golden Company, possibly Sansa, other Westeros lords and ladies that were against her. The people of Kings Landing were not.
What they did to the last season was pretty comparable, yeah.
3/10 troll, try harder
We\u2019ll see, the new trilogy was supposed to be new stories and look how that went lol
Exactly. The new trilogy began with a rehash of the fourth movie and the second movie in the trilogy was illogical and simply poor.
A lot of movie-goers won't be familiar with the books/video games and it would be the first time we would get to see it in a cinematic format.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are tons of films and television shows adapted from existing works including, of course, GoT so an adaptation isn't necessarily a bad thing.
If there is one thing D&D can do its adapt.

Ball washer? Wtf are you 12.... you\u2019re triggered and all I said was to grow up and respect others opinions that are different than yours, if you can\u2019t accept that I doubt you get far in life.\n\nSeriously grow up and get a life kid
Those aren\u2019t battles though. Like I said they had a few mini fight scenes but no battles. \n\nthat\u2019s your opinion that those scenes are better. they\u2019re good sure but idk about better choreography. that\u2019s just simply not what I was talking about , though
Yea, but I mean like ostensibly The Long Night was a battle episode, but there wasn't really any more fighting that that Syrio fight in Season 1, it's almost entirely just piles of wights on top of people who aren't dying for some reason. The Long Night was a battle for the fate of the world and its less engaging and less action than Tyrion's trial by combat in the Vale. I guess its just my opinion but ultimately my point is more fights/battles doesn't need to mean less drama/politics/intrigue/good writing
ok but you've still replied 3 times with nothing. why?
I explained why. You can't argue with integrity.
I dont know what GRRM has planned ofc, but honestly the 3ER being evil in the books wouldn't surprise me too much. It's actually a fairly popular book theory. After all, the 3ER is tied to the CotF, who were the original natives of Westeros that were invaded by humans and driven to near extinction. If the 3ER ends up taking over mankind it's like the ultimate revenge for them.
Just seems like not a very satisfying ending, even as a subversion of the genre like GRRM likes to do. All this just for an evil all-knowing dictator to take over? \"Mwahahaha - The End\" would not be a great ending to all of this.
Won't refer to season 8 writing other than telenovela from now on.
You're completely correct, and it sucks, but it is what it is and there's no option but to hate it because it's rushed, or just love it for what it is and what they did with it.
I choose the third option, be annoyed because it could have been so much better. A shitty ending to a great series.
It is in fact very transparent in the way Bran acts. He always stresses how things have to happen.
Except he really doesn\u2019t though. He literally never stresses any of that outside of \u201cyou were where you supposed to be\u201d and \u201cwhy do you think i came all this way\u201d. - Two lines, that\u2019s it...
Did he really change anything with Hodor though? He was the exact same throughout his entire life that Bran and most anyone else knew. He was always going to be affected by Bran meddling in the past, it just hadn't yet happened in the present. It's all predetermined.
I know, but GOT showed us that reasons do not matter. KL changed his position in the world, they used the same gate entry for KL and another city, it's just random.\n\nMaybe you're right, maybe the writers are, we just can't know that.
Well this one is actually obvious that it is true. The children of the forest were forced to flee to the north because of the first men moving in from the south. They made the NK for a last ditch effort to win the war.
God knows what Disney are doing with Star Wars tbh, the only think I\u2019m looking forward to is the madalorian show, everything else is just extra
Disney are doing the exact same thing D&D did with season 8: subverting expectations....\n\nPerhaps thats why they hired D&D
If you prefer Stan that works too
yeah I agree with you there but all I was saying is they steered in the direction of battles and flash visuals rather than the actual \u201cstory\u201d. \n\nI think we can both agree the 8th season is trash and it all went downhill after GRRM stopped getting involved/they strayed away from the books
and you've based that on one comment, despite me trying to open up the conversation after that? imagine assuming someone has no argument and then using that as your argument for not expressing your own argument. what an exercise in futility.
> and you've based that on one comment\n\nNo, you did it twice.\n\n> despite me trying to open up the conversation after that?\n\nAgain, why would I engage with you when you just call people mentally challenged for having a different opinion? I gave you an out to explain you exaggerated, but you doubled down. So, explained to me why I would engage in an argument with you about the show if you legitimately believe I'm mentally challenged for liking it. It's straight Ad hominem off the bat, bro. You cannot argue with integrity, so it's a waste of my time. You cannot be reasoned with.\n\n>  imagine assuming someone has no argument \n\nYou presented no argument. You just called people who liked this season borderline mentally challenged. Excuse me if I didn't assume you actually had one when I gave you an out and you, instead of presenting your argument, just doubled down on your insulting accusation.
The ending is the planned ending GRRM had...are you sure you don't mean the events leading up to it?
The ending is shaped by the events leading up to it. You cannot examine the ending without looking at how it came to pass.
Take any of Bran's dialogues in the previous episodes. He is always speaking of events as if they happen because they have to. What does he say to Theon? \"Everything you did brought you where you are now, where you belong.\"\n\nWhen he meets Jamie, he only acknowledges that Jamie pushing him led to him becoming the 3ER, again implying that everything had to happen the way it did. He also asks how does Jamie know that there is an afterwards, which once again establishes that he's not able to see the future, but he knows that there is really only one line of events that can take place.
And what is the point of Theon in that scene? Nothing...  \n\nAnd you haven\u2019t addressed my point that things only happen because characters do ridiculously out of character things. Also him causing Hodor literally establishes that if he wants, Bran can affect any timeline he pleases.
dude, the mountains were just outside KL would have you believed back then that some seasons after there would've been a desert just outside the city?\n\nI 100% agree with you, it's obvious, but they showed us they can subvert expectations. The show is over, we will never know.
Probably best to not compare season 8 with the other seasons. They rushed season 8 to the point that they had to change entire map layouts to make rushing easier.
>You presented no argument\n\ni said the last season is \"objectively\" bad. that is a statement of an argument.\n\n>Again, why would I engage with you \n\nyou're still replying lmfao. you've spent 10x the time not saying anything than you could have spent actually engaging with a discussion and presenting an opinion. is this what you do with everything in real life? just sit on the fence until you see one side being the most popular? do you have no real opinions for yourself? you just stutter and stall when someone asks you to explain your beliefs because they aren't really yours?
> i said the last season is \"objectively\" bad. that is a statement of an argument.\n\nSo, not an argument. Got it.\n\n>Again, why would I engage with you\n\n>>you're still replying lmfao.\n\n*Engage in an argument with you about the show*. Yea, I clearly explained this. You're not all that bright, are ya?\n\n>  you've spent 10x the time not saying anything than you could have spent actually engaging with a discussion and presenting an opinion.\n\nI don't do that with people who cannot argue with integrity. Talk about an exercise in futility.\n\n>  just sit on the fence until you see one side being the most popular?\n\nNo, I call out people for having insultingly ignorant positions, such as yourself. \n\n> do you have no real opinions for yourself? you just stutter and stall when someone asks you to explain your beliefs because they aren't really yours?\n\nI have lots of opinions. I've no reason to share them with you at the hopes of objective discourse, because you cannot do such a thing. You cannot argue with integrity. You just label people who disagree with you as being mentally challenged. You do not have an argument, just ad hominem attacks. \n\nAlso, lol @ your comment being removed. Hopefully that gives you the slightest clue about how inappropriate it is to say the things you've said.
Your argument that it only happens because of \"out of character\" things is invalid because it only works on the meta level. In the story itself characters can't act \"out of character\" because whatever they do IS their characteer.\n\nThe Hodor argument though is convincing imo.
How about a survey for the whole season and then the whole series?
Keep in mind, the online backlash started with the Dorne storyline and how Stannis was written in season 5.\n\nThen season 7 had it's own set of problems with concerns like instant teleportation that was dismissed as \"nitpicking\". Took awhile but it finally bubbled up
I don't understand how people could dismiss the teleportation during the entire journey beyond the wall.\n\nApparently all this can happen within a day: Gendry can run back to the wall (since when are blacksmiths good runners?), send a raven, said raven flied to Dragonstone and Daenerys managed to fly north and also find them. All within a day (or less or more, we honestly don't know as time basically doesn't exist in the show anymore).
The IMDB scores are pretty rough too. The 6 episodes from Season 8 are in the lowest 6 spots in the overall episode ranking.
Have you seen the score on Rotten Tomatoes as well? Ouch!
It may not be the worst episode but it\u2019s significance in the story will always cause people to treat it more harshly. This is literally the episode that brings everything to a close, everything you have been hoping for over the past 8 years. \n\nBran becoming king was so left field and a nonsensical decision. It wasn\u2019t early and make the whole story feel empty.
I disagree, I think this really was the worst episode ever. It was a really terrible episode, the only ones that give it a run for its money were in this season.\n\nSeasons 1-4 were great, Seasons 5-6 were a drop-off in quality but we're talking a dropoff from a fantastic show to just a pretty good show. Season 7 was where it started to becoming really mediocre, but mediocre still isn't *awful.* And there aren't any episodes from seasons pre-S7 that specifically stand out to me as being bad on their own.
You liked the sand snakes confirmed
I agree, the journey beyond the wall is the stupidest and worst episode(s) in the entire show (and whichever the episode in which that Dorne girl said \"You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy\", fuck that episode.)\n\nFuck that episode was filled with teleportation, plot armor, plot convenience, and it was just a dumb mission from the beginning.\n\nLiterally all it did was to give the NK a dragon so that he could destroy the wall, that was the writers' purpose of that journey.
That \"Why do you think I came all this way?\" line *really* pissed people off.
Yes. For someone who doesn't \"want\", he showed particular arrogance about taking the throne. I would say he wanted it very much.
He picks when he wants to be a Stark and when he wants to be the raven at the plot\u2019s convenience.
As it should have. You can\u2019t just put in a sinister line like that, accompany it with upbeat triumphant music *and then never mention it again!*!  \n\nWe still know fuck all about Bran. When has wanting power or wanting the throne ever been a part of his character? When has he ever been shown to be a master manipulator of anything? (And no the dagger doesn\u2019t count, you can make that argument but it was never explicitly stated he had any other reason for giving it to Arya other than because he\u2019s a cripple). What was the point of his warging? What was the point of his time altering abilities? What was the point of him learning Jon\u2019s heritage? Aside from very very brief visions of what appears to be the sept explosion and Drogon flying over KL *nothing* else implied he knew the future and was manipulating events?  \n\nYou took a crippled boy with inexplicable powers, gave him an incredible journey which included arguably the shows most powerful scene (Hold the door), and then turned him into a pointless emotionless robot who\u2019s abilities or motivations are never explained in the slightest, and the sum of his contributions to the plot are being used as bait so the entire overarching plot of the show can be shanked out of existence by a teleporting teenage girl, and then being elected king for even more mind boggling reasons.  \n\nI mean pretty much none of the main characters had satisfying arcs in the end, but Bran was definitely the worst
Its so 2000's action movie ending line.
The 60 seconds later says to Tyrion that he doesnt want to be king.\n\nGet the fuck out of here you stupid prick. If you didnt want it why come all this way?..... and then no fucker pulls him up on that!!!!\n\n Fuck me the script was bad.
Bran is the true villain at the end of this series who got the Iron Throne by doing practically nothing and letting hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians die, it's infuriating
Yeah especially since this Lad had no I mentions of being king or a Lord
I dont fucking know. Cus your sisters rolled your ass all the way here while you stared blankly at people.
And then when he appoints Tyrion as hand and Tyrion says he doesn\u2019t want it, bran says \u201cand I don\u2019t want to be king\u201d. ??????????
well blame the show writers for not showing us when he revealed information to different people throughout the show. my favorite example was the ending of Littlefinger, based on everything we were shown up to the point we were led to believe LF was going to get his way, please tell me Arya didn't check with Bran to learn the truth. She recognized just what he could do the day they met under the tree.\n  \nIt simply can be put to down to he told who needed to know and only them but its not beneficial to the audience to know what is going to happen so we cannot be shown interactions with Bran for that reason. \n  \nthat last line is probably just par for the course with regards to writing quality
I liked it lol
Hes worse than Frodo at this point
> That \"Why do you think I came all this way?\" line really pissed people off.\n\nThat's something I dont get; I personally saw it as more of a \"I knew I had to become the king and so thats why I'm here\" not as a power craving \"yes I came because I wanted to be king\" kind of line. Maybe I'm the one that's wrong though but to me it makes a lot more sense, especially with the \"upbeat triumphant\" music.\n\nI've also assumed from the start that the 3ER is not evil and just does what he's supposed to do, with no hidden motives, so maybe that's also why I assumed it was a positive line.
Worst Line and scene of the whole show.
Well I mean, it speaks for itself
It was an insanely stupid line, considering like two episodes ago he said he couldn\u2019t be lord of anything. The writers must really think the audience was dumb.
when I read the leaks, I was shocked, he was the last on my list to get the Iron Throne. I thought it'd be Gendry because he got legitimized, and surely there must be an actual reason for that other then Daenerys gaining more loyal soldiers. But then I thought, there hasn't really been any build-up whatsoever indicating Gendry with leadership skills so he can't be the king. Neither can Tyrion, it'd be hella awkward if that happened. But for Bran to be the chosen one, never in a million years would I thought him as a candidate lmao.
Tyrion being left out of the story was the worst of the worst for me. Literally makes no sense.
The thing is, he had the potential to be the most interesting. Instead of wasting so much time with his story we could have spent it getting to know him and his powers. Is the 3ER good? Does he still feel? What does he want? How do his powers work? Why does he act the way he does? Doing so could have made the White Walkers more interesting too.\n\nThe problem is he ended up being a dull and poorly explained character. Him taking the throne could have been interesting, but it just ended up seeming stupid. I wonder if the showrunners only found out he was king later on and mistakenly downplayed his arc.
I just don\u2019t understand why the OG 3ER had so much more emotional scale than Bran did once he became the 3ER. Fucking robot.
I agree. Although even if they found out later about Bran being king they honestly could have cut out the Brienne/Jamie, Arya/Gendry, Bronn/Tyrion scenes and given us a couple 3ER scenes, or just added a few more minutes. Not that I have an issue with any of these scenes, I just don't understand why they'd add these subplots that are relatively unimportant to the story when, clearly, there was something extremely important about the 3ER. There's actually a lot more about the 3ER in the books so it's not like they didn't have extra material to work with.

Who was the first King of Seven (sorry Six) Kingdoms to be selected by popular vote.   Damn this script.  Damn it all to hell.
What did you expect? He did literally nothing significant entire series and then he's being crowned as king lmao.
He never did anything and for whatever reason he got the throne... Hell, Three Eyed Raven and didn't do anything special except being stoned and flying around with a raven and killing Hodor...
No, he's just the least people's favourite. For all you know he could be everyone's 2nd best.
Really. Bran.
Fewest*
:|
He absolutely 100% was the least popular before the final episode, aside from Rickon who was just a footnote. I don't know anybody who was particularly interested in or cared about Bran at all. On top of that, we don't know dick about his powers, really, and they were never particularly useful in any way, despite the show spending plenty of time on him.\n\nI think the last episode pissed people off enough that they voted Rickon over him just out of spite.
He's the new Joffrey.
[https://twitter.com/vornietom/status/1130522571210838016?s=20](https://twitter.com/vornietom/status/1130522571210838016?s=20)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis person gave a wicked Bran theory that makes him a lot more exciting.
Everyone's seen that theory, and it was made a before that person rambled on it. Was on ASOIAF after Episode 3.
He was an odd choice... no leadership experience and no charisma
Because his character serves zero purpose to the show than to utter dumb bullshit and state off into the distance.
Well that's because they turned him into a creepy, almost inanimate part of the set for the past two seasons. What made GoT great was its dynamic characters and complicated plot, which he was not only left out of most of the end of the series, but also apart from for most of the middle. His story was always tangential, then non-existent, then they made him king. What?!
How dare you say that about our king!
Forget Rickon, even Dickon is more popular than Bran
Rickard.
Ser Pounce is more popular than Bran
Everyone likes a good Dickon :)
It's still called seven kingdoms. I think.
They said Lord of the Six Kingdoms multiple times
Dude you spelled vagetreble wrong
Vegeterrible*
Vegemite
They didn't bother to even try and bring Catelyn back either as the one ghost character
Unpopular opinion. But I think Bran is great. Even better in the books.
Protest vote? I can only read it as someone saying \u201cI don\u2019t like any Stark in the show\u201d
This is an insult to my boy Ned, who died long before his character could be ruined.
Nailed it. The other Starks turned into caricatures of themselves.
1. Most people weren't terribly interested in Bran before he went all 3ER\n\n2. When he went 3ER, he lost literally all of his personality and he became one of the least interesting characters to watch on the show.\n\n3. Bran getting his powers ate up a lot of screen time and was, in the end, almost entirely pointless - which was already making people like him less and less as the series closed out, but then the \"Bran is king now because why not\" twist at the end pissed off enough people that they probably voted Rickon just out of spite.\n\nRegarding Catelyn: I think it's just that most people would vote other Starks (who are still alive) over her, and there are also probably fans who started watching later on and may have missed her entirely. Ned, conversely, was a fan-favorite character in the short term he was around, got a LOT of screen time then, and he's also probably the vote for people who want to express \"I preferred the old show.\"
Just wait until Grrm finishes Winds. Rickon will bring Unicorns to Westeros and fucks Ramsay's army.
Shaggy dog was pretty bad ass so it's a package vote I suppose
The same way ghost is so loved. Characters that D&D just forgot about for seasons at a time
I think because everyone hates Bran *that* much they probably chose Rickon out of spite, which I can\u2019t say I blame them .
> While I'm not exactly surprised that Bran is the least favorite, how the hell did Rickon get so many votes? He was the most useless Stark of them all.\n\nI liked Rickon in the books and show. \n\n A lot of the child characters got aged up significantly for their roles in the show and go on to do a lot within the story and travel the kingdoms, meeting different people (as high lords would). \n\n Rickon is just a child who has (hasn't?) grown up as he witnessed his father leave, all of his brothers leave (Not sure how he viewed Jon) and got stuck in Winterfell with his crippled older brother and Theon. \n\n He was the innocent character who just wanted a normal life and couldn't really comprehend everything that was happening and just wanted to be with his older brother (Bran) and to grow up.
> Catelyn should have beaten him at least \n\n&#x200B;\n\n My brain glitched and took this as: If Catelyn had beaten up her son, he would've been less useless.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(Whelp, guess who's getting sterilized. /s)
I was pretty disappointed that her ability to steal faces never came into play again. Just like a lot of things it leaves you wondering \u201cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201d
Poor writing; and two folks who probably wanting to go play Star Wars. How'd they take how many years between seasons to fuck not only the cast and show over, but the writing and fans. HBO should never be given the reigns of something lile this. HBO; we know how to write 4 good seasons of a series; then we just don't know\"
Hey, she is badass.  That is how she recognized that a genocidal lunatic was a killer.
\"I know a killer when I see one\"\n\nPeople who torch entire cities tend to be killers yes....\n\nGreat observation
\"Woah now Arya, I'm just supposed to take your word for that?  I'm going to need at *least* a 20 page paper with citations.\"
after being ok with her brother bending the knee to the very same person.
People eat that shit like burrito.
But people eat that shit up.  That's the exact kind of lame that spawns Twitter worship.
I agree. The \"I might die, I like a boy, boink boink boink, all night long\" facade was pretty tiring too.
What? She was scared or crying on screen for half the season?\n\nPlus, the question asked who was your favorite Stark overall not your favorite Stark in a poorly written season.\n\nIt's not surprising when you consider: \n\n1. Tywin/Arya scenes are some of the best in the entire series \n\n2. Arya/The Hound is the best pairing in the show and their scenes are also amongst the best\n\n3. Maisie gave the best performance of all of the Stark kids in the better seasons and was the only one amongst them to get an Emmy nomination. \n\n4. I don't think Arya has a single boring moment in her arc from season 1 through her arrival in Braavos(Harrenhall, list of names, Yoren, The Brotherhood, The Hound, Tywin; etc. is brilliant). \n\n5. The Frey Massacre  is an excellent fan service moment \n\nI didn't like the way she was written in season 7 and season 8 was only slightly better but she'll always be my favorite Stark on the strength of seasons 1-4 alone.
What? She was still fucking great. Especially when she killed the Night King. She saved the fucking world.
Yeah Cat is the most underrated character, maybe in anything. The most well acted, super complex with a mix of flaws and great/badass/emotional traits, just an all around fantastic character.
Yeah, if you take Cat out of the show, the whole thing kind of falls apart
You have to admit, she was kind of a bitch...
Yeah and dany was insane, Jon was stupid, Geoffrey cruel, Tommen weak, Tywin ruthless.  Each characters qualities whether they be likable or not contributed to this amazing story. So I admire them all the same, what\u2019s there to admire about rickon? Kid came up with the by far worst name for his wolf and didn\u2019t know how to zig zag he made absolutely no contribution to the story.
As a person or a character ? I didn\u2019t love her but I as a lot of respect for her.
I agree - the wight hunt was completely pointless in retrospect. Cersei didn't send any of her forces, and they easily won even without her help. Thoros and Benjen died for absolutely nothing.
It was pretty pointless at the time, not just retrospect. What about Cersei made it seems like she would be convinced? It was pretty clear that the writers knew they wanted the NK to have a dragon and had to reverse engineer a plot to make that happen. And thus Dumb Plan (TM) was born.
It would have made a hell of a lot more sense if they planned on leading the wight through the streets of King\u2019s Landing, helping Dany to look like the protector of the people. \n\nCersei could then send her army north, but only so far as the Neck to stop the Northern Coalition from coming south. History repeats itself but in reverse when it becomes clear that the Neck can\u2019t hold against dragons - Cersei and the Lannister army retreat to King\u2019s Landing and the Golden Company gets wiped out at the Neck. \n\nThen they don\u2019t have to change too much from the general trajectory of the plot other than covering up stupid mistakes (like Dany forgetting about the Iron Fleet). It would have made a neat dichotomy between Dany coming to King\u2019s Landing as the protector of life and then coming to the city as the harbinger of death. \n\nAgain, I think that a lot of problems this season come down to the fact that too much was crammed in in too few episodes and seasons. Let Dany\u2019s desire to be feared rather than loved take up more than 30 minutes of screen time. Make Tyrion\u2019s desperate desire to be loved and accepted by his sister, and guilt over killing Tywin, serve as his justification for trusting Cersei so much. Just give the audience and the characters time to breath and act like real people.
Easily won? Only if you know you have plot armor. Hopefully the characters aren't aware of the existence of D&D
I get we needed more time for the turn of Dany; but damn. They wasted 1 full episodes on pointless grobble in episode 1. The army of the dead can move stupid fast in battle. Yet they march super slow?
That episode sucked after the ending lol.
> completely pointless\n\n\nI agree, but an argument can be made that the wight hunt convinced Dany that the NK & AotD needed to be defeated.
It's called bad writing. I will never recommend this show to anyone because every storyline gets thrown out the window for big budget and looks in S8. Entire show ruined in 6 episodes they should at least get an award for that.
I mean, just because it didn't work doesn't mean it was the wrong decision. They needed ALL the help they can get. This was their only hope of getting her to fight with them. It didn't work. Sometimes you gotta take risks.
It convinced Jamie to go north.  His presence clearly motivated Brienne.   \n\nWithout Jamie,   Winter fell is overrun quicker, and The Night King kills Bran before Arya can Air Jordan.
Realistically they should have just asked Cersei for a truce so that everyone could complete final preparations for winter. Both sides have been devestated by war,  the wagon train raid showed that King's landing was at real risk of being starved out. EDIT not saying that would have worked either, but it would have been a lot easier than some crazy raid to capture a white.
Don\u2019t forget Viscerion
Man, if Emilia Clarke was my aunt, you wouldn't even have to ask me twice.
So, it is all about cocks in the end as Jaime admits in S7E1
Dumbest story of the series..still ridiculous how that episode got good ratings and reviews
It was much more ridiculous than anything this season
 \"not taking one for the team and fucking his aunt\" lmfao
It depends. Do we judge a decision by the information available to the characters at the time, or with full hindsight? Some good decisions turn out horribly...
Not only was it a bad decision in the show, it was also a terrible decision by the writers. S07E05 is precisely the episode where the whole show goes to shit and never recovers.
Even someone with half a brain would have realized that Cersei has no reason to help, even if the WW are real. And when you think that the one that came up with this plan was Tyrion, the one tormented by Cersei from his birth (according to Oberyn) and who was presented since the beginning as a very smart character that also knew what kind of person Cersei is, is even more mind-boggling.
Telling Jon who his parents are has to be up there.
And then the dead dragon was hyped up in the finale of season 7 and then it really did nothing after that.  What a damn let down so many of these plots were\n\nIt was such a stupid plan and stupid writing I thought the only logical thing (at first) was Tyrion was manipulating them somehow for the good of his own house.  Now I realize it\u2019s just shitty writing
You didn\u2019t even need hindsight to know it was the worst decision. The wights aren\u2019t smart. Set a trap, come back in the morning. Boom! Got yourself a scary dead guy! Or maybe send more than like 6 guys to get em.
Catelyn arresting Tyrion wins.
What a dumb bitch, that one. She did not deserve my man Ned.
So the conclusion was that the D makes the world spin? :P
Worst thing about that wight hunt is they could have easily just not burnt the next dead watchman or something. No need to have a whole big storyline about it.
Idk planning to put a huge proportion of the living army into an unarmed cavalry charge is mighty dumb. At least there was reasoning with Beyond the Wall.
All she wanted was the D and he didn\u2019t deliver. Moral of the story: Satisfy your woman and she won\u2019t go out and kill a million people.
Note: wight hunt only exists to extend the final season into two smaller seasons. \n\nFor an addendum to the close second, can we add not giving any dialogue to Jon for  exposition on his feelings (or lack thereof?) for Dany? Totally unclear to me whether he lover her or not... or maybe that's the intent? Dany: \"Jon loves me, Jon loves me not, Jon loves me, Jon loves me not...???\"
I dunno. Tywin not locking the toilet door behind him was a pretty bad mistake.
Plus Jon Snow himself goes on this daring, wacky mission. Yeah it puts a character in there everyone cares more about so there's dramatic tension, but that's pretty pointless to have him in the party logically.
This will happen  \ud83d\udc4d
You rock!
Maybe make a post where you take some suggestions for different questions / answers?
You\u2019re the best!
Also, one question should be \"Do you think S8 made the previous seasons less interesting for you?\"\n\nPlus, at \"Who was the most interesting villain?\" you should clearly add Bran :P
Top draw.
I can't wait.
Well he could just, you know, return to Winterfell. There's nothing really forcing him to go North after Greyworm leaves. Even his \"exile\" makes no sense.
Actually shouldn't he be able to? Sansa doesn't bend the knee to Bran so Winterfell can do whatever the hell they want.
Does he even want to return to Winterfell? He and Sansa never seemed particularly close in the show, and that was before she betrayed his trust.\n\nAlso, without White Walkers the North isn't quite as horrible a place to live. The final shots even suggested it was starting to thaw.\n\nBeing a wildling might not be so bad, all things considered.
Yeah he loved being a wildling in the early seasons
I was one of the people who said Jon the Just. I thought I was clever. Apparently not.
>ttyl\n\nExcept not because they\u2019ll be too busy ruining Star Wars.
That's already been done.
Probably that describes the notes GRRM gave them...
No shit, their job as writers was to fill in the gaps and create a compelling story that achieved the bullet points given by GRRM. They failed spectacularly.
It's clear the writers just wanted to be done with the show and move on to other projects. That's the only explanation I have for this cluster fuck.
that's not a scoop, it is known
I think it was more that he was weird and I never cared about his story and then some how he magically became the most important person in Westeros for the dumbest reason in the dumbest way. Plus the other Starks were more entertaining and had better stories/arcs
See I found Brans's story line to be the most mysterious & intriguing throughout the entire show, but yeah they ended it horribly.
Rickon?
bUt hE hAs ThE bEsT sToRy ThOuGh
Even before becoming the 3ER i feel his story line was always the least talked about, it just felt so disconnected from everything else and his characters was always kind of boring, the only likeable things in his arc were Hodor and Summer.
Don\u2019t forget about Jojen and my girl Meera. I liked them when they were around.
Bran's storyline was one of my favorites before the whole Hodor climax. It had a fun supporting cast in Osha, the Reeds and Hodor, and the mystery of what the White Walkers are and what his visions mean was interesting. It's just the conclusion that sucked.
I haven't known anybody who ever really gave a shit about Bran. He was more popular than Rickon, but only because Rickon barely existed. They spent so much time on Bran, he became the 3ER and lost literally all of his personality, and in the end him becoming the 3ER ultimately just felt kind of pointless anyway. Rickon beating him out was just a spite vote I think, but if you removed Rickon from the poll he would have been last no matter what at any point.
That wad the main problem of GoT - the storylines werent connected. This also led to the biggest disappointment with the almost meaningless battle for Winterfell and the death of the NK. \nAnd all they did to connect the two plots was making Bran the king?
Not to mention completely stupid and illogical.\n\n\"I'm not Brandon Stark anymore\"\n\n\"I'm the Three-Eyed Raven\"\n\n\"I'm no one\"\n\nThen in S8E6\n\n\"Bran the Broken!\"\n\nLike wtf.
[deleted]
>\"I'm no-one.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeason 5 No-Show Bran trained with Faceless Men confirmed.
> It just felt so forced\n\nYup. I don't ever recall seeing him transition from normal Bran in training to emotionless Bran. One seen he is normal, the next scene we see him he is emotionless. No transition, no clear or well illustrated reason, just forced.
Yeah, I think D&D went for unpredictability for the sake of unpredictability. No one predicted Bran because no one thought such an inane character would be picked as king. But D&D didn't realize unpredictability alone doesn't make a good story.
I think the intention was to make him like a puppet figure and have the real power be those who rule on the board, so nobody is actually truly with sole power. But even then, still weird.
I had to vote him because I thought back and realized how much I liked his character. I loved that he was filling the role his father left and marching to war to save his father
He got rated behind Sansa... WTF?\n\nPeople need to go back and rewatch seasons 1-4. Before the show's writing took a turn.\n\nRobb's story came to a tragic end yes, but his character, his flaws, and his greatest mistakes were all beautifully written.
I'd argue Robb suffers from being to similar to Ned. I chose Ned but Robb would've likely been #2(possibly Jon).
Amen.
There's not going to be any spinoffs based on this era of GoT.
I can easily see them doing a spinoff with older Arya, especially if the prequels go well. Casuals will love the idea and HBO will make bank.
No spinoffs for the main cast or anyone from this timeline.
Maybe there\u2019s like a weird limbo of nothing-ness if you die but are meant to be brought back to life? Definitely would have had some plot conflicts but plot didn\u2019t matter much in the 8th season anyway
Also, a lot of the storylines of the Starks were influenced by Ned and his teachings to his children. He let Arya start training, set Sansa up with her \"dream guy\", taught Jon and Robb about integrity and honor.
Agree. I feel like the true overall winner of the GOT is ned. You canclearly see his philosphy and actions ripple through the rest of the story ajd characters whilst tywins on the other hand led to the demise of most of his family other than tyrion who killed him.
Very true.
Were people counting the young Ned flashback scenes when they voted? They're brief but I didn't even think about that. I was only thinking of Sean Bean's portrayal.
Seen Been is that dude
He played Ted Snark
he is a lovely human Bean
I always thought him throttling LF was kind of a dick move, but overall he was cool. Earned my vote.\r\rHis speech when he's talking with Varys in the dungeon is one of my favorite scenes in the show.\r\r> You think my life is some precious thing to me? That I would trade my honor for a few more years of... Of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and learnt it well. I grew up with soldiers. I learned how to die a long time ago...\r\rChills. So good. Also kind of meta in that it's Sean Bean delivering it lol.
It\u2019s an interesting motivation for why he refused to let go of his honour. But what about his children? Was he fine that they would be left alone in Kings Landing with no one else to care for them? That was incredibly selfish what Ned did in hindsight.
When I saw that combination, I thought that would be the least likely to happen considering that Jon will not leave the north anytime soon and Arya will definitely stay as far away from the freezing cold as possible
It won't be freezing cold, grass was starting to grow, you could see a sprouting plant when Jons walking North
Everyone will meet everyone again except Arya who will never return imo.
I mean she will just end up in Essos. It's well established in the lore that the world of Asoiaf is round, and that if you go west of westeros you end up in Essos.
I thought the same about Arya (only that she would die because she didn't find land), however I was left with a feeling that none of the other would meet again at all. Though Sansa may travel north and surprise me and Jon or if she were to go to KL because of some obligatory event\n\nIt only felt like Jon and Arya were close-knit too me
I don't think people went by logic, but by the feel the series left them with. To be honest, a lot of stuff in this season (way too many) were illogical at best.
Indeed. I hate the excuse that \"This is a fantasy series with dragons and magic, it doesn't have to make perfect sense!\" Even in a fantasy setting, a story still needs to adhere to basic internal rules, such as the laws of physics, logic, common sense, and consistency with the story's *own established lore and character development.* \"Suspension of disbelief\" isn't limited to just imaginary creatures.\n\nAt the very least, seasons 7 and 8 needed to be full, 10-episode seasons to give the story room to breathe. Ideally, it should have gone on for 9 full seasons, and with D&D replaced as writers if they made it clear they weren't willing to put in the effort anymore.
there was too much fan service in this season and it really wrecked timing and how scenes played out by the end. Instead of missing pieces of the story we got fan service scenes and that did not benefit anyone
Maybe the North is what's west of Westeros.
It would be funny if Arya has every intention of seeing Jon again but didn't want Sansa or Bran to know she was planning on coming back to westeros to visit.
We've seen people teleporting all over the place, distance is not a hindrance in Westeros
They hatin' on my boy Tyrion by not giving him a redhead dreamy queen. They even hinted at getting their marriage back on track during the battle of Winterfell
Bran and Jon are the second most likely to meet besides Bran and Sansa, the others have like, zero chance IMO. Arya is gone for good, flat out. Even if she doesn't die a horrific death like she would in the books for trying to sail west, there's no way she'd ever come back or make the journey back. \n\nJon is going north and has zero reason to go back south, the only person he might ever interact with is Bran, if Bran retires and also returns to beyond the wall to live in a tree again. \n\nSansa will likely meet with Bran for diplomatic stuff and maybe visits, but she'd never go beyond the wall or out to see
I voted for Bran and Jon as one of the more likely ones in case they find out something else about the White Walkers and Children.
Yeah they did. They fought against the Greyjoys together. I believe Rob said it had been 9 years or something like that since they'd seen each other; Robert's rebellion ended 17 years prior.
To be fair though, that was back when Westeros was much larger, a trip from Winterfell to Kings Landing took quite a while. Westeros has gotten much smaller, it's like less than a day trip to get to Kings Landing apparently
Oh yeah! Still only once in 17ish years though, and Bran and Sansa wouldn't travel to fight in rebellions.
YOU'RE THE KING'S HAND! YOU'LL DO AS I COMMAND, OR I'LL FIND ME A HAND WHO WILL!
I think Sansa and Jon will have the best chance to happen considering that they're not that far away from each other
I get the feeling both really don't like each other. Sansa basically spent three seasons undermining Jon and ended up with his title at the end of it.
Politics and cooperation would bring them together though.
Bran is an evil, smug little shit with the voice of somebody from Hull.
I've been saying for 5 days now that while there are legitimate gripes with this season (the pacing), like 90% of the whinging is contrived circlejerk from people who just weren't paying enough attention to get through the (unfortunately) faster pacing.\n\nExhibit A.
This really is the correct answer because:\n\n* Arya and Jon are the 2 Starks that the majority of everyone cares about\n* The relationship between Arya and Jon is one of the most popular relationships on the series and even their reunion was the most anticipated reunion for Season 8 so people just like thinking of them together and hanging out
I'm one of those who voted for Jon+arya as most likely reunion and don't see my reasons listed in these comments so will explain myself.\n\nFirst let's get suspicions of positive bias out of the way: I don't really like any of the starks that ended up alive, found them all annoying for various reasons (i did like jon and arya at one point but grew sick of them in later seasons), so it's not about me being fans of those characters and being hyped about reunions. If you had to twist my arm and force me to name a fav stark of the survivors it would be Sansa who I used to despise but ended up neutral towards her because her cattiness made me lol and her evolution into a grown up mean girl made sense, only stark that wasn't ruined in my eyes. \n\nSo why did I say I believed Jon and Arya are most likely to meet up one day? Because they are the only ones who actually like each other enough to go through the trials necessary to find each other. For all the talk about the Starks being a pack, I honestly felt they didn't care much about each other at the end.\n\n\\-Bran Stark: isn't likely to travel from KL and view him as a hands off king who will spend his time warging and giving cryptic advice whilst letting the council do the heavy lifting, occasionally indulging in 4d chess moves. I don't see him becoming nostalgic for his family or even caring much for anything anymore so the odds of him visiting any of the others is remote. If he does want to see his family, he will just warg and spy on them and be done with it and i'd hardly call that a reunion especially when the other party doesn't even know he is there.\n\n\\-Sansa: doesn't actually like any of her surviving siblings, tolerates them at best. And she is queen of her own kingdom now so will be plenty busy managing her affairs and continuing the stark line (once she has kids she will have even less inclination to travel north to visit jon, who again, she doesnt care for that much to begin with, so they could be close together geographically speaking or on opposite sides of the world, it's not likely to happen). Any contact she will have with bran will be via intermediaries and ambassadors, it is unlikely Sansa will ever travel south again and Bran won't be going north either as explained above.\n\nJon: Is actually the most sociable of the surviving starks which kind of says it all...And the dude is so ned like that he won't break his oath and will stay in the north, so won't be visiting sansa even if he really wanted to.\n\nAnd being with the wildlings he might be hard to find, I just don't see queen sansa mucking around in the untamed north risking herself to find jon for a friendly chat.\n\nWhich leaves me to...\n\nArya: Yes she is last seen sailing away, but unless she dies at sea (and she is such a fan favorite i'd find that end a bit anti climactic, though perfectly in line with what GoT used to be) then chances are ONE day, even if its in 40 years time, Arya will come back to westeros even if its for a short nostalgia stay.\n\nAnd which of the starks would she go see? Jon of course, they are the only 2 to have a bond that might endure the test of time.\n\nAnd unlike Sansa, I can actually picture a seasoned Arya being able to trek across the north to find Jon wherever he might be. If she survived her boat ride, that should be ez pz.\n\nAnd that is why I voted Arya+Jon most likely reunion over sansa+jon (who are not even that \"close\" btw, the north is huge and jon isn't likely to have a fixed address that makes finding him easy) or sansa+bran (they have 0 desire to meet and neither would want to move from their respective kingdoms). That was my tldr of the day!
Very well said!

Confirmed, there were TWO that said that
Kings Landing was an inside job. Bran knew about it before it happened. Dragon fire cannot melt steel beams.
I like your thinking. This even fits with that useless white horse at the end of Episode 5.
Yea it was pretty stupid how the last scene of E5 is Arya leaving on the white horse, and then her first scene in E6, she's still in the city, but on foot, and the horse is never seen again. Wtf was the point?
[deleted]
\\>Only one thought in mind\n\nHey, he was also thinking about fucking the queen.
Maybe that was by the by. 88% of people agreed that he knew Kongs Landing (thanks to op who first wrote the typo) would burn. If he knew it, why not try to stop it? Maybe don\u2019t tell Jon about his parents?
Its sort of like Dr Strange, but evil.
/u/Grochen
[deleted]
Neither option is in any way established in the series.
Do you watch Marvel movies? I'm trying to be vague in case you don't. They are referencing that.
After reading someone else accidentally calling it Kongs Landing I can\u2019t help but refer to it that way now.
I think you\u2019ve hit the perfect episode.
I'm so glad people keep making this typo.
I'm telling you, if the show ended with a scene of Jon finding a WW spiral and a shot of just Bran the show would have a VERY different story
Yes! That\u2019s what I think! I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s what the writers intended, let\u2019s face it probably not, but it\u2019s right there in the script!
I dont think that says he's evil at all. He might either be 1. neutral and just goes with the literal flow (of time), and does what he SHOULD do based on what he's seen, or 2. he's a good guy and alternates the future for the best result. Yeah a million people died, but maybe that was actually the lesser of two (or a thousand) evils, and that's why he \"let it happen\".\n\nOf course, yes, maybe he IS evil, but I feel like it would make a lot less sense if he was evil imo.
Deciding that a million people should die to ensure a better future is exactly what caused everyone to say Dany was mad, and for her to be killed.\n\nSo why is it different when Bran does it? Because he knows for sure?\n\nIt\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a good answer.
Well, we never know.
A more positive interpretation is that he recognized that without him there as a compromise candidate, that meeting would have ended in another war.
Is it possible Bran was just referring to the wheelchair bound month long journey it takes to get to KL from WF? Surely he went down south knowing they would have to determine a king or queen and that\u2019s what he could have meant by that. I\u2019m not entirely sure Bran is completely all knowing. I mean I won\u2019t deny he knows who will play important roles in future events and what not but are we really going to say Bran knows everything that is ever going to happen in the future?
I really can't see travel time being referenced by the writers of beyond the wall and Teleporto-pirate...
Well of course, I just prefer the Bran as villain-take on it
I have to admit a while ago someone else accidentally wrote Kongs Landing and it really made me laugh. I can\u2019t help but refer to it as Kongs Landing now.
Even in conversation now I can\u2019t help but refer to it as Kongs Landing. Someone mentioned Cersei Lannister throwing barrels out of the red keep and it\u2019s an image I can\u2019t get out of my mind!
If that's the case, then the writing was still terrible. If the 3ER had some sinister plan all along to take the throne then they should at least have explained who he was
I agree it should have been explained which is why I\u2019m hopeful it will be explained in a prequel. I hate thinking they would take advantage of the viewer by leaving us with this hole, but the only explanation I can think of is they are saving that story. Otherwise, it is just crappy writing. \nThe only positive thing I can think of about leaving it unexplained is it allows the viewer to create their own story and fans to supply some amazing fan fiction/theories. Now that it\u2019s ended I will miss reading all the theories on this subreddit. It added an element to the show that I really enjoyed and isn\u2019t common among most shows. But that isn\u2019t for everyone so I understand the disappointment many have.
Where has it ever been said that the 3ER has the ability of seeing possible future outcomes?
I don\u2019t think it has,  but he has seen flashes of future events. When he was north of the wall searching for the 3ER he had a vision that showed a dragons shadow flying above KL and I believe in another vision he saw the Sept of Baelor explode before it happened. The 3ER really never been fully explained. So I am in error I do not know he sees all possibly outcomes. That was a far stretch on my part.  He would be able to see the past though which would have helped him decide that a Brandon was the right choice. That is only if the previous 3ER already knew of Jon\u2019s heritage. Did all the previous 3ER memories transfer to Bran? I guess if we knew that maybe we could understand the 3ER motives more?
Who said that Bran isn't Bran any more? Bran.\n\nWho then said \"Yes I am totally Bran, King Bran* actually?\" Bran.\n\nYou're taking one thing that he said as gospel while ignoring his later decisions. I can see why you'd do that, because Bran/the show as written doesn't make any sense and we're trying to make sense of it, but that's not what it is.
You\u2019re right I am taking one thing he said and making it gospel,  but I\u2019m also looking at his behavior. It really does seem after he became the 3ER that Bran does not exist anymore. For me I see Brandon Stark and Bran/3ER as different characters. There seems so little of Bran left after he became the 3ER. Unfortunately, it\u2019s left to the viewer to try and figure it out because it wasn\u2019t given time to be explained.  At least it gives us fan theories to read, but it does leave us feeling unsatisfied.
Those responses could have been the 3ER lying.
I didn't interpret it like that. He's still Bran, just not the Bran everyone knew. He's the Three Eyed Raven, but hes still \"Bran Stark\". Like...think of it in the sense that Sansa season 8 is NOT Sansa season 1. Then exemplify that by like a thousand. That's how I thought of Bran when he told people like Meera that he wasn't \"Bran\".
Yeah I think it\u2019s probably a flaw in the writing, but nevertheless it\u2019s there in the script. \u201cWhy do you think I came all this way?\u201d\nUnintentional subtext: \u201cTo be King! My plan worked! Push Danny\u2019s buttons until she snaps, let duty bound Jon kill her off and then roll in as the leader of the seven (sigh, six) kingdoms.\u201d \nRewatching the show from this perspective will really change your views on Bran\u2019s journey I think.
The \"Bran is evil\" theory relies on some really weird beliefs about the quality of D&D's writing.\n\nIn order for it to work, their writing is bad enough that the \"true\" resolution of the main plot is only conveyed through a particular interpretation of 2-3 vague things that Bran says and a particular interpretation of his vaguely defined powers, all of which completely runs against the tone of the end of the episode\n\nAND\n\ntheir writing is also good enough that the interpretation of these few lines isn't just the unintended implication of the few lines that they wrote.
lol if he shut his mouth about Jon's heritage none of this would have happened
\"It's your choice, Jon\"\n\n\"The future is written\"\n\nSo the guy who knows the future is written also tells a dude that he has a choice?
Maybe something even worse would have happened. Dany's madness seems to have been an inevitable development, so is it better to let a single city burn or save it but then Dany goes mad years down the line when she's got an empire stretching across 2 continents comprising tens of millions of people?
But Varys actively tried to stop it.
Well according to the survey 88% of people saw that.
Same. Plus that badass never lost a battle. What a stud.
He was a lot more of a dumbass in the show though. He just fell in love and abandoned his vow instead of choosing Jeyne's honor over his own after a moment of weakness when he found out his brothers were murdered. \n\nThe parallels to Ned sacrificing his own honor were a lot more satisfying.
Ned?
[deleted]
What about Ned? He might've been an honorable fool, but he knows how to keep a damn secret. Robb broke his oath and got his family and men killed.
You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain.
Should have just married the Frey girl.
Long Live Robb!
They kind of forgot about spellcheck.
Too bad Game of Thrones is over or they could all have bright futures writing for the show
Not as if they are being paid millions to do it though
Or they dont actually know english because they **dont speak english** besides Google Translate English :P

It's not impossible to do at all. There are software that does this instantly with a click of a button, nVivo for example, possibly many others that are open source.
we kind of forgot about that
Are you talking about the viewers or the writers!?
yes
BuT iT wOuLd Be A tOuChInG mOmEnT
Seems like a lot of people assume the plot is going to make as little sense as the plot has made previously
Then why is everyone mad?
Especially the writers of the show \ud83d\ude48
IMO Arya has like 10% chance of even getting back to Westeros
Bran had like 0.01% chance to become King. Arya won't just be coming back, she'll tow Westereros back east with her boat.
\"You underestimate my plot armour!\"
Arya is going to die at sea. Everyone who has ever sailed west has never come back. Unless, of course, her plot armor will protect her, but if she was anyone else, she'd die.
Probably because the rulers are the two characters people care the least about. They want to see a Jon & Arya reunion though.
Of course that was the reason. People thinking with emotion and not actually answering thequestion.
Lol they\u2019re other sides of the planet, and Bran and Sansa rule the only two kingdoms in Westeros and have plenty to discuss for terms. How is the former meeting even remotely as likely as the second meeting.
The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Holy Roman Empire were bastions of peasant liberty and political stability, dontcha know? /s
\\^This comment will not receive the deserved number of upvotes.
Not going to comment on the Commonwealth as I do not know much about it, but the HRE had lots of things that were better than in the absolute kingdoms surrounding it. For example it had a semi-independent judiciary, it had free cities that were on equal footing with nobility and who could conduct their own affairs and (admittedly after huge wars) it had a degree of religious tolerance that was missing from England, Spain and France.
Couldn't help but read that as stab-ility and thought, you know what that still works.
If anything the elective monarchy would cause more problems and mean there\u2019s going to most likely be a war every time the king dies
\"The Wheel\" has always been ambiguous and stupid. Does it mean literally what Dany said where the switching of families on the throne crushes the common people? Families only ever switched once, though. Does it mean different families fighting for power, rather than the throne directly? Does it mean the way nobles treat commoners? How was anyone meant to break it? What Dany going to end all houses and rule alone? Was she going to execute any differing opinions? How would she stop scheming?\n\nNothing about it made sense.
Her speech hinted at an \"Enlightened monarchy\" and that is the only explanation that makes sense. \"The Wheel\" is as abstract as the \"Game of Thrones\" and it really looks like both are the same. Breaking the wheel at least promised taking the power from the Great houses. The reign she promised at least isn't a tyranny against commoners but having consolidated power under her breaking the feudal structure.\n\nNow with the elective monarchy the game to reach the top will become even bigger and stronger. So the wheel isn't broken but is replaced with a bigger, stronger wheel.
the last 3ER lived for like 150 years, and died because of the NK not of natural causes. it seems 3ER are almost immortal.
Because a big part of the wheel was the concept of ownership of the throne based on bloodline. Whether or not an elective monarchy would run more smoothly, that toxic idea was eliminated, with the exclamation point being Jon not getting it as the undisputed last heir.
But Bran is immortal. They have a far greater problem now. A King that can see any rebellions or attempts to usurp him coming
But that will cause more LittleFinger and Varys characters to appear and manipulate on who to become kings. And when they'll not like the king anymore, guess who's getting the poison?
But the system is still broken. Each house will still continue on the same concept and more power struggle will arise within the regions and houses as each house have a shot at the highest position. The new system is hardly innovative as the Iron Islands has the same system and it didn't work better for them.
How do you think the Paramounts will be chosen? How do you think the King in the North will be chosen?\n\nOwnership based on bloodline is still strong and that\u2019s assuming that Brans \u201celective monarchy\u201d actually stays stable, which I seriously doubt.
sources?
Also you have a monarch that has all-seeing powers. Big Brother, can see everything, and every citizen is under constant surveillance. He let King's Landing burn, and he will definitely abuse that power.
One would think that the fact that the only elective monarchy in Westeros chose none other than EURON as their King would serve as a hint against this system.
If you put Tywin in at the end of the show, it would be a Lannister monarchy within a month.
especially in this last season,  it seemed much more of a catch phrase that any type of firm plan of the future.  \n\nWhen she is inspiring the crowd and tries to get a chant going 'will you help me break the wheel'  my reaction was 'what does that even mean?'\n\nClearly, it meant to take her armies (dothraki back to horde size, and the reformed unsullied) and conquer all known lands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9Bo89m2f6g\n\nShe clearly explained it.\n\nI'm just not sure how anyone thinks it is broken
To be honest, the only way to \"break the wheel\" in this god-forsaken world is exactly what Dany was planning. If everyone is kept in line through fear, there won't be any wars or backstabbing. Dany made an example out of the people of KL, so if she actually became Queen and took over the world, people would understand what would happen to them if they attempted to revolt. She'll literally bring hell-fires down on you, as she's proven she'll go as far as she needs to go. What she did to KL tells the people that she's not afraid to kill whoever she needs to (innocent or otherwise) in order to keep the people in-line.\n\nIf she ruled the world with an Iron Fist, there would be no wars and everyone would listen to her out of fear. That's what I call \"breaking the wheel\", at least in the world of ASOIAF. If one Lord attempts to rise up against her, Drogon will literally melt their keep and kill their entire family and they won't be able to do anything about it. Very effective leadership tactic in this world imo. Daenerys Stormborn will bring her wrath whenever she needs to, which is effectively breaking the wheel.
The dothraki: \"is the queen dead? Good, whew, now we can go back to being law abiding citizens\"
The show just kind of forgot about the Dothraki.
The Dothraki just kind of forgot they all died at Winterfell, and like a Loony Tunes character when they realized they all instantly died again.
But why would he care if all the Kingdoms came down on them? They're the unsullied, facing certain death without flinching is kind of their thing.\n\nAnd why call/wait for the council at all? Why not just execute them straight away? They had Jon and Tyrion in the dungeon for weeks before all the lords arrived.
Well because Greyworm isn't *really* an Unsullied anymore. After meeting Missandei, he had all the same feelings any other character did.\n\nHe was more interested in protecting Naath for Missandei probably. After the rage of Dany's death, then the acceptance a few weeks later, I'm sure he understands
Jon definitely knew she had done wrong way before Tyrion mentioned his sisters. That\u2019s why he stopped fighting in the streets when she was burning the city.
Jon was so poorly written that it's hard to know who he was anymore. This season he seems to be utterly stupid and too in love with Dany to think clearly. At least that's what the show was pushing. He said he himself he didn't know what he'd do if he was Dany on top of Drogon in that moment. Yeah, I don't get it either. The Jon we all knew would have reacted differently. But this is season 8 where characters we knew don't make any sense anymore.
Yet in the next episode we get him arguing for her for 5 minutes before coming to his senses.
Even then Tyrion did care but he wasn't willing to make the sacrifice of abandoning his evil and bloodthirsty house and family for it until it was his life at stake.
Read the post again. They brought up democracy as an *example* of breaking the wheel. They're saying Dany's definition of the wheel remains intact after the finale.
Chill out, Marx. I'm just saying the wheel of elite families ruling over the little people hasn't changed in a television show
The wheel is the never ending changing of power from one person to another. The wheel can never be broken but the process in which who is selected to have that power can be. No longer is the changing of power happening by force but by selection. Dany was just another spoke on the wheel.
Oooo how I miss college.
She literally nothing personal kid-ed the NK.
\"Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru\" - Arya to the Night King.
personnel*
I enjoy anime and I'm certain Arya wasn't that...
felt little weird that Arya didn't use face swapping since they spent so much time for that training before. would also have been neat if Arya could've gotten near NK using some of that trick.
Exactly
How would that trick have worked against the NK? I can't think of a way. What face in her bag would have allowed her to casually get next to the NK without him or his generals knowing something was up? When you kill a WW they disintegrate so there's no face peeling ritual she can perform to look like a white walker.
I'm personally thinking the South is going to face an economic collapse and revolts soon if Bronn remains Master of Coin, but yeah the weather is better so I'd rather live there. But if the North was warmer I'd probably like to hang out in Winterfell.
I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
Bruh this kind of logic doesn't exist in the world post-ending anymore, given the lord of the other six kingdoms literally didn't have their own interests in mind at the time of Bran's crowning.
I guess the North would also pick their own ruler then? But there wold be no stark in winterfell. I honestly don't know why I care anymore anyway...
Arya would be Sansa's immediate heir, but she might be a bit difficult to reach.
I'm pretty sure men always inherit before women in every Kingdom except for Dorne, both inherit on equal grounds and the Iron Islands, in which they have their own funny little election and offerings.\n\nSo Sansa's immediate heir would be Bran. Infact, Sansa only got to be \"King/Queen in the North\" because the title didn't exist at the time and the northeners had to choose someone to lead them.\n\nOnce Sansa passes away, the title is no longer up for \"re-election\" but will instead pass on to her offspring, and in case she doesn't have offspring, her siblings and then their nephews.
I voted Arya and Jon because of the bad writing. If the show was as internally consistent or as politically savvy as the earlier seasons then Sansa and Jon or Sansa and Bran are the obvious choices.  The show no longer makes sense so I think Jon and Arya reuniting is more likely because it would be a surprise and an emotional beat for the audience.
We really don\u2019t know that. If we had access to the raw data we could look at that, and it might indeed be interesting. But speaking for myself, I complained very vocally about bad writing and I picked Bran and Sansa to reunite.
There are way more people who liked this episode (30% rated it 8+) than votes on even the most popular reunion (13%).
That's not how anonymous surveys work
There is a YouTuber named JonTron
I read somewhere that he was dying and in the process of turning but was stabbed in the heart with dragonglass by the children of the forest
Realizes she is not no one, but a Stark. Gets back home, immediately frees her wolf, tells her family she will never see them again. A lot of characters feel like in earlier season their character had progression and in 8 they had regression.
Either maisie williams or the character herself has gotten her ego inflated because she walks around in every episode like she's the fucking shit and it really annoys me
[deleted]
Literally dies and is brought back for what?  Bending the knee or killing Dany (which someone else easily could've done)
I guess he was brought back to get Dany. Nobody else from the north would have tried to seek her out. So he was a big part of why the NK was killed.
Jon and Dany were both tools for the lord of light. Jons purpose was to unite fire and ice in order to defeat the night king, which undoubtedly would not have happened without those dragons. Once that purpose was fulfilled, he needed to remove fire from the equation as no one should have that kind of power. Which he did and then he was freed to go live a duty free life in the wild. He fulfilled everything the lord of light intended him to. It was necessary for him to be targ because it would have been difficult for anyone else to eliminate dany with her dragon protecting her. His targ blood made it possible for him to get past drogon.
He was brought back because, as hinted heavily in the books, he\u2019s meant to stop the white walker threat. However, readers put this together years ago and d&d wanted to subvert expectations so they rewrote the story and made Arya the one to kill the NK... even though it makes zero fucking sense.
I feel like people are being purposefully ignorant when they say this, if not for Jon the wildlings are likely executed, Ramsey continues to rule the North, Daenerys never even considers the Great War, the Night King probably destroys Westeros. And he stops Dany from destroying the planet.\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t even need to be all of that, it could\u2019ve just been a little thing. Pretty sure there\u2019s a bit of dialogue about it before the Battle of Bastards. \u201cWhy did he bring me back?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe for a higher purpose. Or Maybe he brought you back just to die again today.\u201d \u201cWhat cruel kind of god is that?\u201d \u201cThe one we\u2019ve got.\u201d
> Viserion spits fire at him, he hides behind a rock, survives (this is even more ridiculous when you see what Drogon did to King's Landing)\n\nWe even see Viserion's fire destroy the walls of Winterfell just minutes before this scene
> Grey Worm doesn't kill him immidiately when he finds out he killed his Queen, even though he slaughtered Lannister soldiers for much less \n\nSo much this. The characters change their attitude in 0,5 secondes.
I think Jon has had the most plot armor out of any character, even more than Arya.  He should have logically died Gods know how many times after he actually did die.  In Battle of the Bastards, Beyond the Wall and The Long Night he should have died countless times.  At least in BOTB and BTW he didn't get saved by \"let's cut away to another scene\"
Drogon should have tried to burn him, even with the required retcon.  That could have given a reason for Drogon and company to not kill him but then you have his \"story\" being even more better than Bran's.
Drogon's main attack gets +80 explosive vs stone, while Undead Viserion has a passive blizzard, an AoE ability which slows nearby enemies.
>Drogon doesn't kill him even though he killed his mom\n\nHe's a Targaryen. There's a pretty strong indication that dragons inherently bond with Targaryens.\n\n>Grey Worm doesn't kill him immidiately when he finds out he killed his Queen, even though he slaughtered Lannister soldiers for much less\n\nGrey Worm seems conditioned to only act on orders from authority. The executions were on Dany's orders. Notice how when Bran put his foot down (figuratively speaking) as king, Grey Worm quieted down and followed his orders.
Targaryen dragons killed other Targaryen during their civil war. Dragons only bond with one rider.
And only killed the Waif after getting three fatal stab wounds from her in three seconds followed by an abdomen full of rank harbor bacteria.
Actually annoyed me because Drogo was killed by a small, infected wound showing that people no matter their strength can succumb to nature. Meanwhile someone who's less physically fit with worse wounds, is thrown somewhere that's extremely likely to contain harmful bacteria, and is perfectly fine rather quickly after minor treatment of the wound.
It was two stabs with a small knife in the lower right abdomen where there are no vital organs.  Infection was a possibility but not guaranteed.  I find the Hound's survival less likely than Arya's but people don't go on and on about that.
Show Arya is pretty fantastic in the first four seasons, but honestly suffers the most from season 5 and beyond. The Braavos shit is so, horrifyingly awful.
Show Arya's story went to shit in S6 and never recovered
Show Arya is my favorite. I don\u2019t like her in the books.
I still think it would of been a better choice to leave the night king to Jon, but have Arja kill Dany. In episode 5 with Arja being in the thick of the carnage, I was sure they were setting it up so she was going to kill Dany.\n\nThan again, I would of prefered Jorha to have to kill Dany, that would of been something.
I weirdly wanted her to find Melisandre's necklace and take over her position!
I honestly kept on expecting a faceless assassin to kill her at some point so that they could at least do something relevant.
That was not Arya's whole arc.\n\nEdit.  Added \"whole\".
Her getting poisoned back in Braavos and then somehow surviving because Lady Crane found her lying on the floor would make more sense than having her surviving major stab wounds in her stomach and still being able to run around and swim, like what the fuck.\n\nThe faceless men aren't even known to be stabby. They always make their kills look like accidents.
This is what pisses me off so much with Arya's storyline. I feel like she basically scammed the faceless men but everyone just acts like she completed her training and is one of them now, even though she still retains her identity, like you can't have both. Arya's story would've been way more interesting if they fully committed to her losing her identity in trying to seek vengeance but the showrunners  just wanted to play up to everyone's love of Maisie Williams.
Yea, the internet turns people into irrational hate machines.  But the hate for Arya is mild compared to for others.  Arya is the best.
It seems to have taken over Reddit after the finale and is in direct contrast to the Reddit polls.  So, I think it\u2019s a vocal minority.
I don't know about the books, but I disagree with this notion that the bullet points of the ending were fine, only the execution sucks.\n\nIn the context of the show, Bran becoming king, Daenerys going crazy and Jaime going back to Cersei are horribly unsatisfying endings. \"Oh, but Game of Thrones is not a fairytale!\"\n\nI'm not asking for fan-service, but these endings aren't bittersweet, they're downright sadistic. Daenerys' whole arc, in my view, is about her learning how to be a leader, and to reject her family's troubled history and legacy, and build her own. Does she have to end up on the throne? Not necessarily, but how does a character that has surrounded herself with multiple counselors and constanly asked for advice can have \"goes batshit insane, whatever\" as a satisfying conclusion? Why not use the fact that Jon is not only a Targaryen himself, but actually knew one (Maester Aemon) as a way to show her \"hey, not all Targaryens are conquerors or crazy, huh\"?\n\nAnd I've seen people bring up that Jaime is like an addicted who wants to get rid of it, but can't. Fine, I get the point, but... that's not narratively satisfying. You can't just have a \"tragic\" ending like that just for the sake of it. Have him kill Cersei and die in the process, it's not rocket science.\n\nThe execution was a tragedy, but the bullet points were very underwhelming too, or downright nonsensical in Bran's case. Again, at least on the context of the show, don't know about the books. Maybe it makes sense there.
> And I've seen people bring up that Jaime is like an addicted who wants to get rid of it, but can't. Fine, I get the point, but... that's not narratively satisfying. You can't just have a \"tragic\" ending like that just for the sake of it. Have him kill Cersei and die in the process, it's not rocket science.\n\nExcept that what you just said completely changes it from being tragic to palatable. It's not supposed to be easily palatable, it's supposed to leave a bad taste in your mouth, that's part of the tragedy. Jaime is like a character that has struggled with heroin for 8 seasons, and finally manages to break free in season 7, but when death is imminent you see him reach for one last hit and fall back into his addiction right before a meteor hits his house and kills him. It's bittersweet and tragic because you learn that in the end he never truly broke free of his addiction, but in the very end at least he was happy with his drug, and more tragedy because you wonder if his heroin was the only thing that ever made him feel happy, and that's why he chose it at death's door.
This is an adaptation issue and it does not make sense in the show because of how many characters and plot-lines are changed/omitted.  I fully believe these are the broad strokes of Martin's ending. The entire series was inspired by and starts with Bran's story so I believe him becoming the King is very believable in the context of the books, but came out of the left field on the show because D&D can't flesh things out like Martin does. Bran and Jon's stories are flipped on its head. Jon is the Aragorn figure with the Frodo ending while Bran is the Frodo figure with the Aragorn ending. \n\nAs for Dany, her arc was always very ominous, and there's plenty of hints in the books that she will eventually succumb to her Fire and Blood impulses, but not necessarily lose her mind like the show implied - which I think is an oversimplification of her downfall. She tries to overcome her nature of Fire and Blood by surrounding herself with advisors, but in the end, despite her attempts to make it work that just does not make her happy. Peace did not give her her ideal world - she had to reopen the fighting pits and agree to the return of slavery in the name of peace. She had to tolerate what she sees as injustice because she tried to make peace work, but it just doesn't, not for her.\n\nDany has a strong belief in her own moral code and has a giant savior complex. To her, she truly believes what she is doing is right, and if Fire and Blood is the only way she can \"save\" others and make her ideal world happen, then so be it. She decided in her very last chapter that it was time to embrace Fire and Blood, otherwise she will get nowhere. \"If I look back, I am lost\". \n\nI think the reason why people felt betrayed by Dany's heel turn, aside from the very rushed season 7-8, was the omission of the entire fake Aegon Targaryen plot line in the books. I think this will be sort of similar to her plot line with Jon in the show. fAegon will be seen as a good king, a glimmer of hope after he deposes mad queen Cersei, but Dany comes in with her army of rapers and pillagers, exiles like Tyrion and Jorah and three nukes. She sees herself as a \"savior\". But the people of Westeros don't need saving. There are no chains for her to break. Here, she's just another invader, and in Westeros she can only rule through Fire and Blood.
Totally agree.  They should have abandoned the book endings and written a good ending for the show.  These plot points were never going to work in the show no matter how many more episodes they added.
I think George will be able to do it with the final two books, but I do think it\u2019s incredibly hard to wind all of his narrative to the ending in a meaningful way which is why it\u2019s taking so long to write. The show felt very much like it glossed over all the details, so while enough the ending had enough content to make it feasible understandable, it didn\u2019t feel earned.
Yeah, I completely agree. I think that the story COULD have been fine if they would have done it the way they used to, slow and methodical. They really needed more seasons to wrap things up the way they wanted to. This way it just felt rushed and really badly executed. \n\nSeriously, this season has episodes where more big events or character twists occur than the entirety of season three or four.
He\u2019s not doing 3 books it\u2019s 2. Hell we might not even get 2 anyway.
Oh I know he is saying it is 2... I just feel like I would be astonished if it didn't turn into 3, based on how much left there is to cover. It started out as a trilogy... then 4 books... then 6... now it is supposed to be 7, but I feel like even if WoW comes out, GRRM will at some point tell us he actually is gonna need 8 books to finish the story.
I can understand that perspective, but I do think this is different than a show such as Lost or Dexter for example where the ending was conceptually unsatisfying. At least for me, the part of GOT final season that I didn\u2019t feel satisfied with was the lack of character development, meaningful dialogue, and conflict that brought the show there. It felt more like the shallow cliff notes version of the ending, which is upsetting after having so much depth to the earlier seasons. That being said, I was far more ok with how the story ends than I was with how it was told.

Like how The Long Night trivializes most of Jon's arc involving WW.
The four most intriguing story lines (Jon, Bran, Arya, NK) due to their potential outcomes will now be meaningless filler due to their actual outcome. Wtf even is this season. They somehow blew a 4-0 lead in a 7 game series. Seems impossible but they fucking did it.
Please, I'll keep injecting Hardhome straight into my veins for years to come. \n\nWhat a fucking fantastic episode.
That\u2019s like saying Eisenhower didn\u2019t do shit in WWII cause the Soviets killed Nazi.
Just because he didn't get to stab the main villain doesn't mean his WW arc is trivialized. He's still most responsible for uniting Westeros against the White Walker threat. Not to mention the major role he plays in the rest of the season.
Arya killing him is fine with Me. Jon\u2019s arc was about getting everyone together and leading the fight. He did that.
They always felt like filler to me anyway. Bran's scenes during the show were easily my least favorite. Hell, I barely even remember any of it, just dreading when the inevitable next Bran scene would be where they are all still aimlessly walking north having some meaningless dialog. \n\nArya was, in general, a great character, but she definitely had her share of filler, too. Her scenes in the House of Black and White for instance were awful. The 4th or 5th time you see her being abused and/or being ignored by Jaqen were more than enough.
The end pretty much makes irrelevant like 60-70% of the show
I\u2019m going to be so mad rewatching everything happening with Bran. He goes through so much shit, and other people around him are killed or have their minds broken to keep him alive, only to have whatever interesting mysticism linking him with the wierwood trees, the night king, the wall, the warging etc. go completely unresolved. The whole magic side of the show was left as dozens of loose ends in favor of an Arya sneak attack, then Bran who\u2019s been entirely disconnected by choice from the human political drama swoops in at the last second to become king for no reason; with no basis for why he would want it or why the rest of the lords would support him.
You could say the same about all the Margaery stuff, but in that case it doesnt feel like filler, just like a much much better exposition about how not every character will live out his whole arc
A lot of scene of other characters will start to feel like filler I bet. Problem is a ton of Bran scenes were boring before this and now they are infuriating.
Rewatching would be depressing, the first scene of the entire series is now a parody!
That makes sense honestly. Episode 2 had some super cool scenes (like Brienne's knighting) that are amazing because they are \"supposedly\" the last time you'll see all these characters alive and together. Then Episode 3 comes along, nobody in that scene dies, the Night King wasn't really that big of a deal, and all of a sudden, the previous episode loses a lot of love because much of it didn't mean anything.
Yeah, they were good, but as a setup for what came after it, they are now basically worthless...\n\nThat's also why I feel like the whole season's rotten rating looks too high now. Boosted by some ultimately insignificant setup episodes, while the ultimate payoff is rotten as can be
Speaking the truth.
Yes, I noticed that too. This downward trend started with episode 3, since then the scores have dropped lower and lower for all the episodes.
Which is fucking stupid, it\u2019s just petty brigading driven by spite. Rank the last 3-4 episodes lower all you want.
Well there's 2 reasons i can think of for that. In isolation those episodes were decent and this rated fairly highly. But after the last 4 episodes they ultimately became pretty pointless beacuse nothing really happend to further the plot.\n\nThen there's also the part of the fanbase that just retroactively downvotes everything beacuse they're angry with the finale. Like i absolutely hated the finale or atleast how things went down, i'm not gonna go back and retroactively reduce ratings like that.
I've been watching that too. We're .1 point away from not having a single episode at 8 or higher. Fascinating to watch.
Yeah... personally I skip all Ned scenes, Robb Scenes and Oberyn scenes on my rewatches...  because all that matters about ANYTHING is how it ends,  not how it lives.\n\nyeah, no.   the Night King mattered, certainly not as much as he should have, but he mattered, he killed the previous three-eyed Raven, essentially forging Bran,  wiped out the last of House Umber and Karstark, nearly genocided the wildlings, united  Jon and Daenerys armies against him,  killed a dragon, caused a good portion of the losses that caused Daenerys to go off the deep end.  and would have wiped out the entire world if not for the (admittedly clumsy) culmination of Arya's training, because Dany's army with its tens of thousands of Dothraki, Thousands of Unsullied and two dragons BARELY won, nothing would have had a chance after that, which was the trap the story fell into.\n\nJon's lineage tipped the scales of Dany's choices, her entire reason for 'choosing fear' was that Jon was clearly the more loved of the valid candidates,  his arc also emphasised the idiocy of divine right, Jon's last leadership role ended with him being stabbed to death.   it was never about his right to be king, it was always about how he neither wanted to be a king, nor was he the best suited.   his entire story was about the shift from being a bastard pariah to finding a place where he belonged, mattered and could be important to people,  he was completely swayed to the Freefolk lifestyle back in Season 3, only rejecting it out of moral obligation to the Night's Watch,\n\nthe a huge portion of the story is contingent on lies, false narratives and the conflict they cause.  the story that Rhaegar kidnapped Lyanna incited the events that culminated in Robert's rebellion,  the lies of Joffrey's parentage propagated the war of five kings,  to have Bran's ultimate destiny be that of the King who can see through these falsehoods is a strong thematic hook, it just isn't handled very well.   it doesn't ruin his story in retrospect.
Thank you. I winced with embarrassment when angry joe said Jon\u2019s lineage and resurrection didn\u2019t matter at all. Whether you enjoyed the series and execution or not, that\u2019s simply objective nonsense at best.
Yeah nobody rates shit like the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie lower just because the later ones were shit
Don't worry mate, winter is only a couple of episodes :)
[deleted]
Still cold
this is what I thought! nearly everyone agreed on bran knowing what was going to happen and still letting thousands of thousands of people get burned alive so he could sit on the throne (or just on his wheelchair by whatever is left of drogon's anguish). so why why why would anyone want to live under his rule? I think I'd rather have sansa as my queen, as she does seem to have at least some experience with these politics.
It is better to be under someone's rule like that, than to be against them.\n\nIf he were letting thousands of people die with that decision, then how many people do you think he is letting die with Winterfell's newfound independence?\n\nThe little sociopath probably knows that The North doesn't have the means to keep itself fed through winter and would rather give them their independence so that they starve to death, rather than have them stick around and be a burden to the rest of the realm.
Right. She also has the experience with the logistics of ruling. \n\nHowever, I am honestly not a huge fan of her either.\n\nJon: I need you to keep a secret.\nSansa: Ok.\nAlso Sansa: Hey Tyrion...
Does it really matter? As a commoner I'd probably live a life of whatever no matter who reigns so I'd rather live a place where it is warm.
I imagine some of the people in Kings Landing felt similarly, and Bran did nothing to stop it. \n\nIn fact, I could argue he was a contributing factor to it happening.
The only good reply I've really gotten. I hate being cold too
I wanna live in Dorne with all the bisexuals!
Also, how the hell does Westeros have control of the wall when it's in the north now?
Or being a total bitch to the Lord of the Riverlands - a region that until that moment were entirely devoted to answering the call for the Starks whenever they were in need.\n\nShe doesn't make alliances - she breaks them.
Or openly asking for independence from your brother in front of the rulers of the other Kingdoms, essentially ensuring future revolts.
The funny thing is, in terms of a rewatch, the Lannisters are by far the best to see their arcs again. Cersei literally having her house of cards fall on her. Jaime having a all too realistic relapse (it seems weird on a show, but this is exactly what addiction is like, and it's often never depicted this well) and Tyrion actually having the bittersweet ending of having a high power he doesn't want.
Plus, the big woman. And I hear she's single now.
Edmure shouldn't have spoken.  He has had nothing to offer the world besides his value as a hostage for years.  His sad sack performance at Riverrun tells you all you need to know about him
Oh yeah right, he should've let his infant child and his men be slaughtered, sure.
Yep. It's a little vindication. \n\nI really, really wish it had gone otherwise, though.
Oh yeah, I totally agree. The big thing for me is that I never really got time to dislike or question Daenerys. She was a little cold at times, but out of nowhere she torches kings landing? And they never really actually show her on the dragon once she is destroying everything. I found it hard to connect the action to her. \n\nThen 5 minutes later she is dead. It was too much too quickly.
Yeah I would give practically anything to have the series finished out strong. It was in contention for my favorite series of all time and now it can\u2019t really hold a candle to them.
Honestly, only the second episode had any real depths to it. The scene where Brienne got knighted and Pod sang is so darn good. \n\nOverall the character interactions was more than shallow one-liners.\n\nBy far the best episode this season, and the only episode I'd call good.
I wholeheartedly agree. By the time we got to the small council meeting I was pretty much over the one liners. \n\nThe second episode had some great depth (relatively) to it. It was also genuinely funny with the giants milk story lol
Why, because than you feel justified to have an opinion?
I wouldn't say that. It does make me feel more justified IN my opinion. \n\nIt also gives me people that have similar feelings to talk to about it.\n\nAnd some of the people that have spoken out against the season as a whole, have donated a good chunk of change to Emilia's charity which may or may not have happened otherwise.

> And who the fuck is Aaron Rodgers\n\nif you're actually serious he's the Packers quarterback and he was an extra in episode 5
Only 11%? Damn people here really are way to generous to this last season.
Hahahahaha, dude that was HILARIOUS! Game of Thrones is bad!!!
Always? Absolutely not. Up until ep4 where Rhaegal died the majority of the people were pretty satisfied with the show.
Yup, but I think FFN is where all the dany haters ended up
So... we should tune out everyone who's online and well informed? Sure. I'll ask my grandmother.   \n\nAnd also- have you not seen Facebook, twitter and instagram? The amount of hate there surpasses this.
> If Ned Stark's execution happened in this season, it would be described as \"trashy\" and \"lazy writing\".\n\nIf Ilyn Payne jumped off a balcony in King's Landing and stabbed Ned while saying something super edgy because he kinda forgot he had no tongue, yeah.

I would say most (albeit not all) of what happens in the finale is consistent with the show narrative, but somehow it seems this sub is not accepting a *single* thing about the ending. It's all shit.
I don't think it's stranger than any other character this season or the previous one.\n\nI just think it's weird the voters clearly love her but the comment section reflects the opposite
Comment sections are always cancerous.   Look at any comment section anywhere online and its the same.  Hate is a strong emotion and people want to vent.  And the internet allows them a degree of anonymity so they say things that they would never say in person.
That\u2019s not what their comment was about.
This is probably the most show positive sub.
if you really believe that, I recommend subs like r/asoiafcirclejerk and r/DanAndDaveFanclub r/SansaWinsTheThrone (and probably other GoT Character Sub-subreddits). You will see that this sub is still extremely negative.
Well that's just silly.
Agreed. I think every ill with the season can be tied to the decision to the shorten the last two season.
It went from character driven stories to a plot driven narratives.  They took all those ending moments you point out (spinoffs) and then worked backwards to the first episode.
There has to be some fall out for this? If they had finished the show with the quality of the first 6 seasons they would have been gods in the directing/writing world, anyone with a movie or series to shoot would have given anything to have them involved. After how they treated this ending I would be apprehensive to give them any story I had written, what if they half ass the end again? What if they half ass the whole thing?\n\nThere was only 1 chance to do this show given how it started, no one is going to want to re do it as it would be compared to the original 6 season's and it would almost definitely fall short, you cant just re do the end in 10 years as thats stupid. \n\nAt the half way point of this show, with the quality that it was they had guaranteed this was the only chance to tell the story right and they didn't do it. Now it will always be not as good as it could have been, and I dont want them to get away with it.
What interests me is the connection with Star Wars now.  Disney must be in full damage control mode.  People are mad/disappointed in D&D and will likely take it out on Star Wars cause it's the only real action they can take against these two.
There should be but there is no god of justice, only the god of tits and wine.
I have no doubt that some HBO executives are punching themselves in the dick right now. Probably ganging up on the poor bastard who argued for the \"artistic freedom\" to allow D&D to finish the show the way they wanted to.
D&D really shouldn't be allowed to write any more. Imagine them utterly destroying other long-beloved franchises. This is worse than Michael Bay's version of stories.
Here, here! (applause)
D&D don't care.  Disney threw boatloads of cash and 4 star wars movies at them.
Judging by the viewer numbers, I highly doubt it.
uh... maybe not?  at least one higher up was complimenting them.  smh.
Has there been any comments about the ratings from HBO or D&D? Arguably the biggest show in TV just ended and I haven't really seen anything from the people in charge
>the end of episode 3\n\nFTFY
Yeah even though many fans weren\u2019t admitting it at the time the show died with the NK being inexplicably shanked out of nowhere by a character whose plot has had nothing to do with the Army of the Dead.  \n\nCersei and Euron were laughably contrived OP final bosses. What were the stakes once the NK was killed? Nothing, and that was the issue. Why should i care at all about the battle for the iron throne when Dany has been outrageously nerfed since 7.01? Not to mention she defeats the Lannisters in *exactly* the same way she could have done in 7.01. All her defeats in S7, the entire NK plot and battle of Winterfell - Lol yeah none of it mattered, all you need is Drogon to take the city
I agree. This was the episode that really cemented the fact that the show was beyond saving. They basically ruined one of they key plotlines of the entire series in a matter of minutes.
>the Wight Hunt in season 7\n\nFTFY
>all of episode 3
DURING episode 3. \n\nFTFY
>the end of Season 7\n\nFTFY
>the end of episode 3\n> FTFY\n\nThe start of Episode 3 \n\nFTFY
by episode 4 is essentially the same as the end of episode 3
Episode 3 tanked the show. It made all the previous seasons pointless. I was the biggest GoT fan up until episode 3, and then I just resorted to memes and leaks to be able to cope with the disappointment.
*season 5\n\nEdit: I originally put season 6 because at least season 5 had Hardhome, but even that doesn't rule out Dorne
The best episode of s8 is inarguably 2.
inarguably is a very funny word to use when it comes to opinions
Have a real discussion or any kind of real interaction between Dany and Jon, that explained her actions and made us actually think he liked her. \n\nShow the fallout of her death! How are you going to kill the arguably main character of a story and just skip over all of the fallout, show no emotional reactions from any of the characters except her dragon?\n\nHave Jon and Greyworm fight. They built up to it before this, and there's simply no way Greyworm would let Jon live. Or if they're not gonna fight, then *don't* show Greyworm executing prisoners right before this, because those two things don't make sense together. Either he kills prisoners or he doesn't, don't show both in the same episode with no explanation.\n\nDon't make Bran the king, goddamn. So dumb. Either Jon or Gendry are the king, or they just split up all of the kingdoms in this episode. If Jon's not the king, there should be a good political reason, not just \"These guys who are on their way out won't allow it, for the week that they're still on this continent\". Jon should've had a character-defining choice to make in the end, just like Arya did when she gave up her revenge on Cersei, just like Theon did when he died defending Bran. \n\nSansa's political arc should've paid off. Just asking for and being randomly given a kingdom is not Littlefinger-esque scheming; it's no better than the bratty wannabe queen from season 1. This was a complete failure in character development payoff. She should've used her hard-earned wiles to scheme for a better outcome for Jon or the kingdoms.\n\nBronn should be dead, come on. No way he should be lord of Highgarden.\n\nEtc. Etc. There was a lot of stupid stuff in this episode, from the minor to the major, even just off the top of my head.
Jon and Dany did have that interaction and it was more than i could have ever hoped for in one episode to explain her mindset. Not sure why you imply this didnt even happen.\n\nIll agree on the fallout and fight with Grey Worm, but the way they did it was good too because if youre gonna have a time jump it should be after a climactic moment. \n\nMore debate leading to Bran would have been nice but i think he was the perfect choice. \n\nI dont think the point of Sansas arc was to become a schemer, it was to becaome a leader and thats what she did. \n\nBronn was promised Highgarden, Tyrion gave his word. And Bronns point about how houses start was totally right, now this is the follow-through.
I think we all waited for that, and it never happened. And I don\u2019t understand the reasoning behind that. Why introduce story elements like that, just to never use them again?
That sub will make you lose your god damn mind, I swear to god your sanity will be questioned.
Ya I went way too far down the rabbit hole
Apparently, r/gameofthrones, the most favorite of the show are \u201cLawful Evil\u201d to them
That's the best GoT sub among all the madness.
They thought it was so bad that their rating system looped back around and they gave it a 10.
A few thousand people snapped and went mad perhaps?
the first 20mins were ok so its clearly not a 1. the rest was an absolute shit show so it got a solid 3 from me
I didn't even think the first 20 minutes were okay. They were so fucking baffling at every turn.\n\n* Maybe half of it is spent on Tyrion going to find Cersei and Jaime. I get it, he's looking for his siblings. You can still do that, but it didn't need to be literally 5 minutes of walking through streets and corridors, we could have opened the episode with that.\n* Apparently Cersei and Jaime would have been totally fine if they just didn't stand in the one specifically place where bricks fell down.\n* Excited to find out what was with Arya and that horse? Well, it wasn't important, because she just kind of shows up and watches Dany and the horse is nowhere to be seen.\n* Dany is apparently able to speak so loudly that thousands of screaming Dothraki can hear her clearly. I get that she's Dragonborn but she wasn't even shouting, dude.\n* I mostly thought the scene with Tyrion/Jon was okay, but fuck, Jon is REALLY resistant to say anything bad about the girl he dated for literally like *two episodes*, despite her killing what, half a million innocent people?\n* Dany talks like a lunatic and then gets stabbed after about 2 minutes. Cool. Also, Jon holds Dany as she's dying in the *absolute most awkward way possible* (see the picture for Question 4 in this survey). Seriously, it looked so fucking terrible! I haven't seen anybody else mention this but I'm sure people have.\n* Drogon is either apparently able to grasp the complexity of inter-continental politics and power struggles and destroys the throne as a reactionary measure because it is a symbol of power, or maybe he just really fucking hates chairs, who knows.\n* Oh, we time skipped, and apparently Grey Worm just walked Jon out of there for being a bad boy and killing literally the only person left he cares about after already showing himself to be a merciless killer at the start of the episode.\n\nAnd this is just the stuff that I was actually thinking *as I was watching*, there's more to nitpick if you go back and look at it. Honestly, in Episode 5 I mostly watched the episode and then at the end thought \"okay, well, that was pretty damn bad.\" In Episode 6 it was so bad I kept being pulled out of it because I was thinking \"this is just really fucking stupid.\"

So it\u2019s brainless to enjoy something others didn\u2019t now...?
The writing is the core of any show. If the writing isn't any good, nothing else matters. All other things are build upon that foundation.
Would you rate this episode 1/10?
I gave it a 1. In my opinion, no amount of quality acting or amazing production could redeem the horrendous plot and writing. I gave it a 1 because after years of being incredibly invested in this show, the conclusion was so bad that it didn\u2019t feel real.\n\nI got more emotional reading and thinking about theories in the months leading up to S8 than I got during season 8 itself. To me the entire thing just felt like bad fanfiction- too poorly written and illogical to be taken seriously.\n\nI felt nothing when Daenerys went mad. I felt nothing when Jon killed her. I rolled my eyes at Bran and Sansa being king and queen (in the north). I felt a sort of disconnected wtf when Arya killed the NK. Even when Rhaegal died I was mostly like \u201cwtf that makes no sense\u201d.\n\nAnd in many ways that is unfathomable to me. I was so invested in the show, before. Things that would happen could affect my mood all week. I was devastated when Robb died. My stress level and investment in the Mountain vs Oberyn was through the roof. I literally cried in relief when Daenerys escaped the Khals. I was sick to my stomach when Rickon died. \n\nSomehow this season turned me from being that person into someone that feels like \u201cwhatever, this is just frustratingly stupid\u201d for basically every single thing that happens. I think it was because this season really epitomized what has been gradually happening for the past couple seasons- it no longer feels like GoT is a show where actions have consequences. It used to feel so high stakes, like everything was connected to each other- even small actions in Essos would have their effects ripple across to set off chains of events in Westeros. \n\nBut now it just feels like they\u2019re drawing random events out of a hat for the ending. Aaaaand this week we got... drumroll... \u201cRhaegal is going to die, Braime is going to bang, aaaaand 3X dick jokes! Sorry for all those folks who were hoping for Cleganebowl. Tune in next week and remember, the more you tweet @Cleganebowl2019, the more entries it will get in next week\u2019s drawing!\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with me. But that is why, after some thoughtful consideration, I gave it a 1/10. To me, this was basically as bad as \u201cand then aliens invade\u201d. I would have preferred Bran waking up from a dream.
watching the dothraki charge was when my mind just zonked out and the series became a complete joke.  my mind just couldn't handle the utter stupidity of the writing.  watched the rest of the season in a stupor.  writing was utter shit.  so many people don't realize that that the whole battle was the equivalent of a modern army throwing away their guns and charging enemy machine guns with a knife.
So fucking overdramatic my god
The writing is 90% of the show, so a score of \"1\" makes sense.
cinematography = 10.  acting = 10.  music = 10.  directing = 10.  writing = -99.   minimum score 1.  math checks out.
Really?! The acting felt stiff and forced in many places (due to the bad writing). Sure, the visuals and musical score were good... but IMHO, writing is pretty damned important.
This sub really is vicious to the Sansa fans
She's the worst.
It baffles me also
Lol no, a vocal minority are vicious to Sansa fans. The VAST majority of this sub is unreasonably obsessed with her.
The people who read some of the books gave the episode the same rating as those who didn't read the books. It's quite literally in the poll. There's a bit of a discrepancy between these groups and those who have read all five books, but it's fairly normal for more hardcore fans to be less forgiving and way more critical.\n\nI read two of the books before the show was announced. I stopped reading when the show was announced because it's more fun to read a book after having seen the television show than the other way around. When you first read the source material, it's a lot easier to be dissapointed with the television adaptation because you'll have certain expectations. \n\nMeanwhile, when you first watch the adaptation, a lot of content in the books will still be new and fresh because you can't possibly fit all of that into a movie or series. So you'll be more focused on that and less on the comparison.
Yeah, that's an interesting point. I think it's because the last 2 books introduced characters and plotlines that D&D cut out of the show entirely. And now book readers are just realizing that cutting those things crippled the end-story a bit. So people who have read all 5 books are experiencing an extra disappointment that 75% of this sub won't ever know.\n\nEdit:\n> When you first read the source material, it's a lot easier to be dissapointed with the television adaptation because you'll have certain expectations.\n\nThis is spot on. This is why not reading the books is sometimes the better decision.
This is the first time I have ever connected myself to a book series that is incomplete. I have read through multiple times but only after I watched season 1. \n\n...our watch has begun.
And at least you gave them a shot. I am surprised at how many haven\u2019t read the books at all.
the first one, of course.  a friend gave it to me, saying it's the greatest fantasy book ever.  \nI didn't hate it because it was bad.  I thought it was incredible and a well written, realistic, political drama.  It just wasn't anything close to high fantasy, and I love the escape that high fantasy provides and don't mind the tropes.  it was way too gritty and realistic for me.\n\nI resisted watching it for 7 seasons, but that same friend insisted I watch, and I did, and was amazed, and then... well, you know.
Ughh haha it\u2019s hard to say, I would still rate the episode the same because everything was so rushed and undeveloped. But I think my answers to the specific questions regarding the breaking of the wheel and did the series finale change my opinion on the entire show etc differently. Because after being able to make sense of what happened. My opinions regarding the story as a whole changed. Where as right after I watched It I was still trying to figure out how these characters got from where they started the episode to where they where at when they finished It. So in that sense the episode/ season was still kinda shitty. Not everyone deep dives into what happened like us, so there are a lot of people out there that saw the ending and don\u2019t really understand It.
I tried to explain tyrion's trial to a friend that hasn't seen a single episode and I was amused about how stupid it is even if you remove all the complex character and relationships \n\nSoldier wants 2 prisoners executed but for some reason he waits for a trial, comes with prisoner 1 to the trial, no judge is present, prisoner 1 decides who is gonna be the judge for prisoner 2, the judge is literally the most useless person in the room now and decides that prisoner 1 will be excused and will now serve as his assistant and that prisoner 2 will go vacation with his friends and his pet, soldier thinks the punishment is fair and leaves\n\n\nAnd that doesn't even scratch the surface of how non sense this whole scene is
That Lord's council meeting was such a lazy way to end things. They had a prisoner choose the king, and he chose the wrong one.
> I tried to explain tyrion's trial to a friend that hasn't seen a single episode and I was amused about how stupid it is even if you remove all the complex character and relationships\n\nFor a second there I thought you were talking about Tyrion's trial in S4 and was very confused
Like would greyworm care who the new king is?? Why would he let Tyrion speak and choose a king?? Why were they even in the dragon pit to begin with.. to bargain for Jon or choose a king??
Why do you assume it was a trial? I got it as a council of heads of the most powerful houses. Didin't seem like a trial at all.
Howland Reed, the only dude that can verify Jon's heritage, doesn't mention him at all and votes for his weird cousin to be king that he has never met and who also fucked over his daughter. Jesus christ. Aye.
Yeah just this morning I thought \u201cWait why didn\u2019t we get a scene with Yara about Theon?.\u201d As far as we know she isn\u2019t even aware her brother died.
Why did Yara let Arya threaten her like that?
ugh, stop
I was surprised to even see her. Figured they had just forgotten about her. They did, however, forget about who Yara is and the fact that she had already been granted independence.
We don't tend to get that unless it's really pivotal main characters. Didn't really have any reaction to LF dying for example.
Why did Yara say nothing about independence after the North was granted it when that was the reason she allied with daenerys in the first place?
See, these are the issues I really can't get behind. I totally understand people who are saying that the execution these last few episodes felt really rushed. I totally agree. I didn't mind the ending so much as I did how rushed and confusing it all felt.\n\nWhat I don't get are complaints like yours. You are watching a show about dragons. There's already a lot of suspense of disbelief required. So how come it's too difficult to just assume that Yara has been informed about the faith of Theon offscreen? You can poke a lot of holes in nearly any TV show if you require the directors to put all those events on screen.
There honestly isn\u2019t one main character that you can argue their ending made logical and thematic sense. Dany is at close as it gets and that tells you all you need to know about how badly the other characters have been betrayed. I still can\u2019t get over that thread on here with 15k upvotes that was chastising viewers after 8.04 who thought Jaime was going back to Cersei because he loved her rather than to kill her. The denial was incredible...
Theon! Theon had a redemption arc and he completed it, going from trying to/pretending to kill the Stark boys to giving his life protecting Bran when it mattered most (as far as he knew anyway).\n\nArya almost had an arc. She made a choice in e5 to give up her quest for revenge and choose life and, presumably, family. Unfortunately that was not built up to and they also threw it away immediately when she abandoned her family in the next episode.\n\nBran... Who fucking knows.\n\nDany should've been faced with her choice: be merciful, or be the queen. Instead she became the queen and then also murdered tons of people for no reason, and then never explained it and then got shanked. They had all the necessary elements there for her complete arc and completely discarded them because they're incompetent.\n\nJon needed to have a choice between duty and love. When he killed Dany, that didn't really come off as a real choice, because she was a genocidal maniac and he didn't seem to actually like her very much anyway. And then he never had a choice to be king or not after that anyway, his choices were just made for him. His personality was irrelevant to how his story ended.
I was okay with the hound's ending
Oh my god yes. I was in the Jaime is legit returning because he can't shake his addiction camp. I spent that whole week just lurking and refusing to engage with people who thought I was dumb as rocks for thinking that. I stand by my original quote:\n\n> I get that most people are reading it this way, but it seriously felt like a setback in his character arc watching how it played out last night. Hopefully it turns out better than it felt out of the gate.
I\u2019d say Theon has a pretty good ending from a character development point of view.\n\nAfter all the shit he\u2019s done (attacking Winterfell, \u201ckilling\u201d Bran and Rickon), all the shit he\u2019s had to suffer (Ramsay and Euron), I really enjoyed that his final scenes involved defending the same Stark he supposedly killed.\n\nHim randomly charging the Night King with a spear was pretty dumb, but aside from that I was completely on board with his ending.
Haha for me it is the opposite
The more I think about the trial scene the worse it becomes
I had that problem with episode 3. I just rather not think too much. Even when i was watching it. Just annoyed me so much.
If this was an anime, Arya would be the MC
Yup, very true. The crazy things she does in the show wouldn\u2019t change though because they\u2019re already very Anime-y
The Battle of Winterfell was straight outta DBZ. Jon Snow (Vegeta) is built up to defeat the main bad only for Arya (Goku) to swoop in and save the day.
[This parody comic got it right. This is my favorite fanart of GoT ever.](https://i.redd.it/lzjpbuowgzfz.jpg)
Agreed, I love book Arya, but I've **hated** TV Arya with pure loathing ever since she survived the fight against the waif. That was when she took a turn into a generic TV hero who always survives everything and away from realistic GRRM character.\n\nI mean seriously, the crap she pulled over the last 4 seasons is just insanely wrong, including:\n\n* Survived nearly being killed by the waif because it just so happens some random woman can heal deep sword wounds with just a night's rest and let Arya run around like normal the very next day. Even with today's medical technology it would take over a month for you to fully recover from such an injury, and you **definitely** would not be ready to run for your life and fight to the death the very next day.\n\n* Murdering multiple important members of house Frey and cooking them in a pie without **anyone** noticing something was amiss and sounding an alarm.\n\n* Murdering the Lord of house Frey without anyone noticing.\n\n* Murdering the entirety of House Frey and escaping without a single scratch.\n\n* Jumping in out of nowhere (as if from an Arya catapult) to land on and kill the Night King just in the nick of time, despite being far from the Night King a few minutes prior!\n\n* Cheating death at least a half dozen times as the city was being burnt down and destroyed, including surviving a fire blast from Drogon where they cut away from her a second before she clearly was going to be roasted alive.\n\nThis isn't a GRRM character, this is a TV super hero who can always beat hoards of bad guys no matter how long the odds. It's not what Game of Thrones is about.
I loved Arya's character for the first 4 seasons, my favorite along with Tyrion, and even for most of seasons 5-6.\n\nAfter that, she became some superhero ninja vigilante.  They would show good scenes where she shows signs of her humanity, which I liked, but then they would have her go back to smug robotic ninja again.
Agree 100%. The took the 'badass kid' trope and pushed it so far that she became not just uninteresting but unlikable. Plus the stupid smug look she had on her face for 99% didn't help.
>Even with today\u2019s medical technology it would take over a month for you to recover from such an injury\n\nEven with today\u2019s medical technology those wounds would very likely have been fatal. The Waif literally turned Arya\u2019s intestines into fettuccine bolognese. She could\u2019ve bled out in minutes if a large artery such as the common iliac or inferior mesenteric were lacerated. And between the feces seeping from her bowel perforations and the rank harbor water, Arya had a one way ticket to fulminant peritonitis and septic shock. She would\u2019ve needed emergency surgery (repair any lacerated blood vessels, bowel resection, and washout), big gun IV antibiotics, and a blood transfusion to make it.\n\nEDIT: Grammar
Should have been that Arya got killed by the waif and the waif took her face.
You forgot the worst which is her personality, it has become smug and arrogant treating murder like children's play.
The healing thing was dumb I will give you that...  \n\n\nBut the rest makes sense in her character.  She was meant to be an assasain so quiet and sneaky, even her blood drops are louder than her footsteps.  She escaped without a scratch because simply, she killed the entire house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the catapult, she presumably jumped from a top the wall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso she was not shown for like a half hour before she showed up then.  Jon was fighting the dragon in the courtyard right next to where Bran was.  It makes sense she showed up.  After she talked to the Red Woman, she started to travel over to Bran in order to save him.  The timing was convenient yes, but everyone was fixated on the night king at the time.  Nobody heard her coming and she was incredibly sneaky.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever she did have plot armor from the unbelievable amount of injuries she sustained during her fights.
I surprised that these gaps in logic - purely the fault of the writers - can make you hate the character. Her personality traits still developed in a really interesting and compelling way and that's the core of it. (If you disagree then fair enough, but that's a much better reason than \"she has too much plot armour\".)
Arya is one of those characters that was written to be loved in the very beginning and that has basically been carried all these years and even after she became fucking weird. Book Arya is still alright, but show Arya is the single worst character on this show.
Her character has been terribly written since S6 at least and then it got worse once she returned to Westeros and became this edgy obnoxious & ridiculously OP killer with a constant smug face
I'm not really shocked. And the question was choose your favourite Stark, not necessarily the best character in the whole series. Even though her character became very one-note and strange after season 4, the thing is the other 3 living Starks are not really doing much to overtake her as favourite Stark. And she really benefitted from killing the Night King this season.\n\nBran was never going to have a lot of fans. I'm very surprised Jon was not everyone's favourite Stark, but this season was not very good for him. People mostly love what his character represents: a bastard who's actually a prince, the person who was willing to bring everyone together. But personality-wise, sometimes he's lacking in that area because of his quiet and brooding nature, but people remember the spunky rebellious Arya.\n\nSansa is interesting because her fans have really increased over the last 4 seasons, but unfortunately her character was one of the most hated in the beginning. And the people who tend to love Arya won't easily interchange her with Sansa. It also didn't help that this season she was being compared to Littlefinger and Cersei.
So.. what are the problems with her? Besides surviving stuff she shouldn\u2019t survive, what are the problems with how she acts?
To me, her motivations are completely inconsistent. She gives up her assassin training because being a Stark is too important to her, good. She gives up her trip south to kill Cersei when she hears that the Starks took back Winterfell, good. She tells Jon how family is important yada yada. But then after the NK dies, she immediately bails on her family again on what she says is a one-way trip to kill Cersei. Wtf? Didn't we already get over this? Why did she regress by two seasons suddenly with no explanation?\n\nIt's even crazier because she has the power to end the war single-handedly, and just doesn't tell anyone. Like Sansa in the BoB, she lets Jon  lead a battle to his probable death when she knows she could prevent it, if she just told him ahead of time. This makes absolutely no sense as a character decision.\n\nThen she decides not to kill Cersei and to live instead, which is good in theory, except I no longer even know what her deal is or what's driving her decisions. Presumably she wants to survive and be with her family? But then after Bran becomes king, she bails on her family again! What the hell, Arya? What are you even doing? What does this character value, what does she want? She harps on about family but clearly doesn't give a shit about them. She comes off as hypocritical and basically crazy.
she's perfectly normal and well adjusted.  she should be a traumatized, ptsd ridden mess, a sadistic mass murderer hell bent on revenge with little humanity left.
I liked Arya a lot up until Season 5. She *was* my favorite character. But then they 1) shipped her off to Braavos for almost 2 seasons and separated her from every other character, 2) had her survive getting stabbed in the belly and getting sewage poo in her tummy because why not, 3) had her come back to Westeros, murder people and cook them into a pie totally casually, 4) had her kill the Freys and escape with absolutely no consequences and no effect on the narrative whatsoever, 5) had her kill the Night King because they needed it to happen I guess and there wasn't enough time to make it satisfying in any way or involve characters who actually had any storyline connected to him in any way, 6) made her mostly useless in Seasons 7/8 except for the Night King bit and 7) most importantly *sent her off to Braavos in the first place despite none of that really ever paying off.*\n\nI always told myself Arya had invincible plot armor because they sent her to Braavos and there was no way they would do that without bringing her back to make use of what she learned and have an impact on the main story (even her death in Braavos wouldn't affect anybody because most people didn't know she was there or that she was even still alive).\n\nWell, it turns out that was only half right - she did have plot armor, but they didn't seem to have any plans for her at all.\n\nAdmittedly Arya did some despicable stuff before Season 5 too but it was always interesting. For example, when she kills that stable boy in Season 1.
I had loved her character when the show began but started hating it afterwards (season 5 onwards).
Yeah that\u2019s easily the worst scene in GoT history only challenged by the Jaime/Bronn Dorne scenes. The difference is those scenes were forgettable and relatively unimportant. This scene is arguably the MOST important in the show and it\u2019s ALSO so poorly done
Why did the Unsullied let Jon and Tyrion live so long after Dany dies? It's been weeks and they were killing no-name Lannister soldiers for fun earlier. The guy who betrayed their queen and the guy who killed her get to live? Then they allow Tyrion to decide the king and Jon to go into exile, then up and leave. Additionally, the Dothraki seemingly merge with Westeros and live in King's Landing now (They weren't leaving on those ships) when they should be killing Jon then committing suicide as blood riders do.\n\nThe king decision scene was a huge load of BS. Arya threatens Yara with no effect, Sansa insults her uncle (an ally) for no reason which potentially cripple future relations and alliances, Tyrion picks Bran of all people because \"stories are important\" even though he seemingly doesn't mean all the stories Bran can tell but the story of Bran himself (which is a boring story at best), Bran basically announces he knew he'd be King which begs the question 'Did he allow this genocide and fallout?\", and then everyone unanimously agrees this creep they never met should be king based on the words of a traitor.\n\nPlus all the comedy they threw in in the moments after one of the most influential characters died. Plus the terrible small council scene that actually made no sense. How was Tyrion excluded from the history book? He was hand to 2 leaders, killed a hand, and is blamed for killing a king. Sam shouldn't be Grand Maester since he only got 1 or 2 links and didn't spend the years and years necessary at the citadel, it would make more sense for Brienne to be Sansa's Queensguard, and like you said Bronn being Master of Coin makes no sense. Tyrion should have had Bronn executed.\n\nI could probably go on but it's pointless, the shitshow is done and I'm exhausted.
To add on to what the other poster replied with...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJon's heritage wasn't even brought up in the final episode. Ultimately it just became a plot device for Daenerys even though it's a revelation that has world-changing consequences. Varys was even writing letters in Episode 5 and we only saw him burning the last letter he was writing... so unless we're going to fill in the plot whole for the writers the viewer is left to believe the rest of the letters were sent out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am overall pretty disappointed that Jon never got any conflict or development over his true parentage outside of his relationship with Daenerys, but at least that isn't a gaping plot hole like it's complete irrelevance in 8.06.
Watch pretty much ANY review of the episode on YouTube for the answer to your question.
Arya has done some seriously fucked up shit.  \n  \nMurdered a child whose only crime was pushing her \n  \nThreatened and showed off about murdering that child to another child  \n  \nViolently tortured and murdered many, many people  \n  \nMurdered and then hacked up the dead bodies of 2 men to then bake into a pie Hannibal Lector-style to serve to their father    \n  \nSlit the throats of prominent political figures  \n  \nMass poisoned an entire house\n  \nAnd worst of all, killed the saviour of the world, the one true king that could actually bring real peace to the land: the Night King. And in so doing, literally genocided an entire race from the world.  \n  \nArya makes Dany look like a Saint.  \n  \nAnd that little shit got to make a little judgey face about \"I know a killer when I see one\" and got to go Captain Jack Sparrow into the west...  \n  \nI hope a Kraken eats her
All of what you mentioned except for the genocide of the dead, are why I hated how people keep saying look at Dany's past and you can see she was gonna be the mad queen. Most of the characters in this show have done and threatened to do some fucked up shit
I fucking hate Arya stans
It would work better if her story is presented as a tragedy like it is in the books.
Casually threatens Yara to cut her throat too. This little shit got no respect since she has become the most overpowered character in the show.
I know that she was brutal and messed up, but she was also complex and compelling and that's why I loved the character. I never judge TV characters on how much I want to be their friend.
What child did she murder?
As opposed to the super-psychic  who has zero interest in ruling, knows nothing about leading anyone or running a kingdom, has zero social skills, and is so troubled he murdered an entire city and spent 2 seasons so emotionally crippled that he is unable to want at all.
Well I never said I like show Bran being on the throne either.
Honestly that is what I have hated lately.  Even the last 3, 4 seasons.  It is really cool to watch, but that isn't why I loved this show.  I remember back in season 1-4 they didnt even show the fight scenes.  They would just skip through and show the aftermath of it all with a few dead people on the ground.  Aside from a few 1 on 1 battles (Or something of the sorts) they did not show any fighting at all.    \n\n\nIt has turned into too much of a fighting/battle tv show and strayed from their roots of simply good character arcs, conflicts, politics and drama.
>fighting/battle tv show\n\nWhat the fuck fighting did you see? There was only Cleganebowl. It turned into more of a dumb shit happens and Tyrion says dumb shit type of TV show. If it was all battles it would've been much better.
That's pretty much my dad, never even watched season 1 and just watched the show because its popular. Unfortunately that's who it seems these last 2 seasons were catered too.
Who watches a show like this without starting from the beginning? Gross.
I don't think that's a fair summary in this case. A lot of the rage actually comes from these very people, many of whom were Dany stans who fully expected her to sit on the Throne and bring peace and prosperty to the galaxy, and issues of pacing aside could never imagine her doing anything bad.
The gatekeeping in this thread is fucking insipid hahaha
Book reader here, I'd rate the season a 9/10. Character arcs make sense to me, spectacle was amazing. Could've done with a couple more episodes but that doesn't make what was there less than a 9 IMO.
I really don't understand this. Only episode 5 was full of any spectacle at all. What are casual fans enjoying about this at all? Probably more than half the season is just Tyrion talking random nonsense that is supposed to sound smart. I feel like they did a fucking poor job of appealing to casual fans too, but they still liked it for some reason. They walked the line of like trying to be a smart well written show and being a casual fanservicey action packed romp and it woulda been better to just go full on in that direction instead of pretending to be something else.
Episode 3 had spectacle.
I don't even agree that the spectacle was great this season. Battle in episode 3 was too chaoti c. And dark to even see what was going on. The NK's death was about as lame as could be. I had no idea what was happening with the dragon fight in that episode. The epic fights this season were anything but epic. Compare cleganebowl to the hound vs. Brienne fight. The sacking of Kings Landing was basically just Dany flying around burning things. Compare that to the scene when she takes out the ships at slavers bay. Even the spectacle fell short this episode, partly, I think, because emotional investment in the characters was severely lacking this season after they decided to completely 180 everyone.
I really apreciate it now even more, that I have really loved the finale, after reading all that stupid butthurt comments.\n  I am not your opinion. So what?\n  Guess what, I found it genius! \n   I'm happy and satisfied, and I dont know, but I prefer to be NOT your opinion.
Yup, I think I forget that not everyone is like me (surprising I know)\n\nI hate TV. Haven\u2019t watch a single series of TV in years before GoT, but this show was different. And that\u2019s what I loved.\n\nA huge portion of the fan base watches all the random garbage on TNT and CBS and FX and whatever so GoT is just another night they have plunked in front of the tube.\n\nAnd for those people it was great. Another piece of eye candy they could use to waste the time between work and sleep. All my friends on Facebook who liked the final season fit that description to a tee.
Whatever random CBS TNT FX shows you are thinking are simply better than this season, that's the crazy part. People will still say this season was better because it had well designed dragons and costumes and shit, but a fucking Big Bang Theory episode is way more logically and tonally consistent than this season.
Nope, I listen to a radio show daily that\u2019s decided they were going to talk about GoT while it was on. And they did a TERRIBLE job. Not knowing literally anyone\u2019s names except for Jon and \u201cDany\u201d\n\nAnd they were upset at all the people who didn\u2019t like the finale. They couldn\u2019t even mention Arya by name, just that she was the little assassin girl. Yet they thought the fandom was over reacting
Some people still seem to think Daenerys' name is Khaleesi.
i overheard someone on the bus say that people only dislike it because the show is ending and it made the most sense that 'wheelchair kid' would be leader. They also said dany was 100% alive and warged into her dragon
Ok but hang on that sounds really cool
Maybe a lot of them, but a guy on a forum I visit has been watching since S1 aired, and has read all the books, and he loved season 8. I'm baffled by it too, to be honest, but there we go. There are legitimate fans who weren't disappointed and we probably shouldn't be snobby and dismissive of everyone.
\"if you liked the show you're a casual\"\n\nimagine being this insufferable
They really are casual thou. Not that there's anything wrong with liking things casually but don't complain when people have valid criticism. Like how can anyone be okay with the ironborn and Dorneish just accepting a new king while the north goes free? The same ironborn who rebelled just 7 years ago for their own independence is now blindly loyal to a dead queen who they only fought for because she promised them independence aren't seizing this chance to be free? Or the Dorneish who have defyed Targaryen rule for 200 years just go along with a new king? Stuff like this is happening constantly on the show these past seasons and I can't see how anyone truely immersed in the story wouldn't be tired of having to constantly ignore what the characters were saying to enjoy the show, especially when this show was initially built off the wonderful characters and not constant Micheal bay action scenes.
/r/gatekeeping ?
If the only requirement to get through that gate is naming 5 main characters, after 8 seasons, that's a gate im willing to keep till I die
There's definitely a certain group this season aimed to please, and dismissing those people as \"not true fans\" is stupid. Let people enjoy things.
No one is stopping anyone from enjoying anything.
No. I read all the books twice, watched the series 3 times, and as flawed as season 8 was, I still loved it. I still do, despite what's happening in this thread.\n\nI've been kind of depressed all week though, had some deaths in the family and coming on here compounds that. My GF and I both really liked a lot of the season, the knighting of Brienne, Dany turning into her father, Jon ultimately deciding to abandon his honor, his title, and love for what's right, Drogon destroying the throne. Tyrion throwing out the family monarchy in favor of a voting system was a great step towards democracy and what I always imagined Tyrion's character would offer the world. The coming together of all characters to fight a common battle, drinking together post-battle. Fitting, sad deaths of Theon, Jorah, Edd. The cinematography and music were beautiful, the acting fantastic. There were writing issues that have been talked about ad naseum here, but it wasn't enough to bring down the culmination of it all for me.\n\nSo yes, it's true, I loved it despite its flaws. No, it's not the best in the series. But it ended it well for me and I was massively entertained.\n\nBut like I said, people claiming that if I liked it I \"can't name more than five characters\"... this is just too much for me guys. I might have to stop reading here.
Idk, I could name every main character and 90-95% of every named character, and I thought the ending was alright.  I wouldn't say it's amazing, but the people who are calling it shit seem like the people who would have been mad at every single ending unless it was the one ending they wanted to happen.  And the people who are calling it disappointing probably held D&D to GRRM's standards, which was never going to happen.  Not even GRRM can finish his own books to his standards in ten years, and they expected D&D to do it in two?  There were things I wish were fleshed out more, but for the most part, I thought the end was explained well enough that I could fill in gaps/missing scenes and conversations.  And logically, the plot made sense and was built up well enough for me to accept.  I don't know why people are complaining that Dany going mad came out of nowhere.  She's been this way since the beginning and has always had advisors caution her, and push for mercy.  Without them, no one's there to advise mercy, and we get King's Landing.  On the death of the NK, I'm fine with Arya killing him too.  Yeah, it would have made complete sense for Jon to do it, but I know that if he did, people would have complained that it followed the fantasy trope.  Too many differenct fans, someone will always complain.  People just held season 8 to a higher standard and forgot about the shortcomings in prior episodes.  They've hyped the ending in their own heads for two years, so when they didn't get what they want, they complain on the internet.
Wat. \n\nYou think the rightful heir to the throne who killed a person who just torched an entire city of innocents should be sent to a wall for life to protect the kingdom from the guys they destroyed in episode 3? Meanwhile, they let a little guy who is on trial for treason basically make the most important decision the Kingdom will make for centuries? And then they pick a guy who hasn\u2019t said a fucking thing for a couple seasons. That same guy got a bunch of \u201caye\u2019s\u201d from house leaders who wouldn\u2019t even know who bran was, or much less why he\u2019s fit to be king. Bran says earlier that he can never be lord of anything, but now he\u2019s king. He also says he\u2019s come all this way to be king, so basically he knew Dany was going to killed a few hundred thousand innocents and just let it happen. \n\nYou\u2019re totally cool with Bran gaining all these powers and then just ghosting for the battle with the dead? And you\u2019re also fine with the White Walkers targeting Bran for some unknown reason even though he clearly doesn\u2019t do anything? You\u2019re cool with the White Walkers obviously having some intelligence and motive, but then their story is over before we even understand anything about them? Why were they targeting encyclopedia instead of the A10 Warthogs? \n\nYou\u2019re cool with Arya getting some crazy powers in order to make pies out of tertiary characters and then never use them again? \n\nThere\u2019s easily another season worth of story to wrap up/explain. You could easily make two seasons without it feel like it\u2019s dragging on.
They got weird ass names. I\u2019ve watched the show since the start and am doing my second re-watch and I still don\u2019t know half the characters names. (I\u2019m not one that thought the last two seasons were any good though) \n\u201cYo that\u2019s that bad dude that fucks with magic and green shit!\u201d \u201cYo that\u2019s that dude that sounds like he\u2019s coughing up phlegm when he says his name\u201d. \u201cYo, \u201ccool uncle\u201d shitty jack Sparrow is on!\u201d That\u2019s how I remember the characters.
Casual
You selfrighteos fucks\n\n   Jesus.
That is pretty much me. I don't look too hard at shows and just like it based on how it made me feel. I thought for the most part season 8 was really good, but even I had problems with the last episode.
Except if you don\u2019t care about those 2 things then what do you care about? Action? Because this episode had none. Characters? Because none of them made sense.\n\nThe only people who I could see genuinely enjoying that episode are fans of Bran or people who only watch the series because it\u2019s \u201ctrendy\u201d but have never actually seen an episode before season 6. And I doubt that makes up 10% of this subreddit.\n\nNo, I\u2019m almost completely positive the \u201cAmazing (9.9)\u201d people were only trying to skew the ratings system because they new that so many people were going to crush this episode.
Some people don\u2019t nitpick. As a book reader before the TV series was announced I understand that there are some holes and that not everyone is happy, but I\u2019m sure that I\u2019m not the only one who thought, \u201cwow that was really incredible to have been a part of all this and goddamn what an ending\u201d
They are.\n\nDoesn't mean I can't scratch my head, questioning as to how they came to that opinion.
If I said Scary Movie 5 was the greatest film ever made I\u2019d hope someone would show up and question my opinion. \n\nJust because something is subjective doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be head scratching
[deleted]
Doesn't mean some opinions aren't wrong.
Yeah, but is that reaction really that bad?\n\nIt'd be like 'oh whoa, you support the pro-life bill?' type of realization.
Comparing liking an episode of a TV show to supporting a bill that requires children to bear their rapist's babies. This is some peak /r/gameofthrones shit.
There's no way edmure joins sansa after that
There's a reason he sat down, and that's because he's already subservient to her. If he had to choose between joining his boss-niece Sansa or the people who kept him captive all this time, the Lannisters, of course he'd choose Sansa. Her being rude once is not enough to convince a kingdom to abandon their allies and join their enemies.
LOL it\u2019s a rolling commode!
I\u2019m sure he attempts to jerk off at times. Who knows it\u2019s just hard to take Bran serious
I guess I was in completely different sub full of fanart and cosplay like the off-season and \"unpopular opinion: I liked it\" x100 silver, x1000 gold, x10000 plat. \nAll the fun community left this sub a long time ago.
Have you been in a single episode thread? Post-episode thread? Survey thread? Any of the dozens of \u201cthis made no sense and here\u2019s why\u201d threads? \n\nSure this sub isn\u2019t as critical as r/asoiaf and turned on the writers later but this sub has been complaining non-stop since Episode 4 at least.
bruh what? this sub has been nothing but whinging and the few posts that do say \"I liked it\" get immediately shit on in the comments
This sub isn't r/asoiaf (which really all it does is complain) but it certainly has a lot of defenders. Until 8.06 the last few episodes have had at least two threads simply stating how they like the episode and it becomes a well-liked gilded thread (including one that asked for no negativity and just positive comments):\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bnxnib/spoilers\\_unpopular\\_opinion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bnxnib/spoilers_unpopular_opinion/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is one of the more recent ones I can easily find (I am not investing time to hunt down the rest). I've even seen genuine complaints get constantly written off as haters, people who aren't paying attention, people who should not watch the show anymore, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis sub certainly has gotten negative, but it's not as if there aren't a lot of positive posts either. If it was positive in past seasons and turned negative in this most recent one that is very telling of season 8.
Now *there's* a show that knows how to end right. They're so good at series finales, they made three!
Agreed. I\u2019m ok with all of the major plot points of season 8, just not the execution.
100% agree. I\u2019m just so happy for them they made it
Even as a Sansa fan I found literally all of the rest of it unsatisfying
If anything, it should be worse. My wife and I started the show 4 weeks ago with no spoilers. We clearly saw pacing and writing inconsistencies starting at around the end of season 6 whenever Arya gets stabbed like 4 times and survives and heals in a night. From then on, plot armor and shitty pacing was very obvious since the previous seasons were literally only days apart to us watching.
Yep. This isn't just book readers nitpicking about their favorite theories not coming to fruition. It was a fundamental failure of storytelling. My mother, my sister, and the guys at the barber shop I go to are all show-only people, and they were all bitterly disappointed, and could clearly articulate the problems with the past two seasons' narratives, character issues, and logic.
watching the dorne plot was very jarring.  everything was just completely off.  characters were no longer coherent, and the plot was just...
> My wife and I started the show 4 weeks ago with no spoilers. \n\nMajor props to your epic binge.
I'm a big stan of Sansa and still found this season disappointing, and episode 6 was extremely underwhelming and frustrating for me.
I just lowered my expectations after season 6 and a bit more after season 7. So it was difficult to be disappointed. Also a bit of a Sansa fan.
The show has been up and down for a few seasons now in my opinion. I liked some episodes this season and disliked some others. I thought that the ending felt rushed and a bit confusing, but at the same time I also don't think that any possible ending would have been good enough for me. So I'm a bit forgiving.\n\nAlso, I loved the Long Night. I'm probably a minority in that.
That sub is where you go when you want to ignore the problems this season had, those people legit think this season was absolutely amazing and there is no constructive discussions where they point out issues and if you attempt to voice your opinion that the writing is bad - they say you are just a sheep. Ironically, they have a sheep mentality that this season was actually good - stray to far from the herd and you get hated on.
I've seen the most meaningful discussions (and criticisms) of S8 so far down in the comments on that sub. Unlike others which are just a hate wagon.
I'm not really making any conclusions. I just think it is interesting. I personally saw some leaks by accident and I think it affected the experience. The leaks I saw out of context were really dumb, and when it actually happened it was a bit frustrating.
Yea I meant to reply to the guy that replied to you. Sorry.
> the things the Hound told her before he fought the Mountain were exactly what most people were thinking\n\nBut did those even make sense? He was trying to tell her that she has to be careful and shouldn't let vengeance consume her, but she already murdered a family and baked them into pies to feed to their father out of revenge. \n\nLike, vengeance already has her, and for one person saying \"nah but what if you didnt?\" to just change her entire life made no sense.
I liked the opening sequence and the credits after D&Ds name went away
When the best parts of Game of Thrones are the ones without dialogue, something went wrong
> I disagree with the concept that a popular character should prevail at the end of the story. It's exactly the opposite of what GRRM's story is based upon.\n\nCharacters are usually popular because they are interesting though. What has happened here is a boring character which the audience is not particularly invested in has been put on the throne instead of one anyone enjoys watching. An interesting character getting the throne would have been much better, whether that is a character who is good or bad or likely or unlikely to sit the throne.
You are using different words to say the same thing: you'd much rather have someone that the public loves be the final winner.\n\nThis is not how the story works, it has been established since Season 1 and it's one of the main reasons it's such a good story
Bronn's whole story this season was such a giant mess.
Yeah I think they absolutely wasted him
are you Dan or Dan? You just keep defending this pile of horseshit all over the place...
I didn't like many things about this season. This doesn't mean the story is a pile of horseshit.
Yeah, I get people having issues with the execution of the finale. I agree with that. It felt really rushed and they should probably have done another season if they wanted to wrap things up the way they did. This show used to be slow paced and intriguing, not an action novel.\n\nSo I get that complaint. What I don't get is how a lot of complaints boil down to \"things didn't go the way I wanted to\", which sort of has been the trademark of the show from the start. I have to admit that I do think that Bran isn't the most interesting character, but I also think that he mostly just suffered from the rushed execution and the fact that his story arc has been a bit of an irrelevant mess until the last few episodes.\n\nThey tried to make him a bit more interesting and relevant these last few episodes, but it was wasted effort because he simply had been so irrelevant to the main storyline for so long and a few episodes of screentime isn't going to change that. So again, the story really could have worked well if they would have taken their time with it.
Sure that played a part, but if you deny that Tyrion saying those words him were very helpful in convincing Jon, then you weren't paying attention. And regardless, it was still a great callback to S1.
It really went from bad to worse didn't it.\n\nSeason 7 writing \n\n1. Stupid idea to go on wight hunt and lose a dragon to the night king\n2. Loads of pregnancy related breadcrumbs for all of them to be entirely pointless at the end\n3. Littlefinger plot and the whole fake Arya and Sansa bickerings\n4. Bran returned only to become a zombie tree man with no sharing of any of the information - what good was it for him to have all that free internet bandwidth with no use to anyone. It is still literally unbelievable that NK came only for Bran\n\nSeason 8 - well there are probably 10-12 things wrong which I am not going to list and all of them are worse than the season 7 ones
The Arya and Sansa bickerings weren't fake.
Yeah, which is why I'm okay with it. I think that whatever ending the show would have had, it wouldn't have been satisfying. Except maybe an open ending. I can't think of any big show ending that was celebrated, except for Breaking Bad.\n\nIt's a bit dissappointing that they rushed it so bad that it became confusing. I think that to wrap it up like they did, they had to spend way more time developing the story arcs rather than changing characters seemingly at will. Still, it's been one of the best shows I've ever watched and a lesser ending isn't going to change that.
They are not trolling. The ppl that gave this episode a 10, just gave every other episode a 10. Consistency and some questionable intelligence.
So, they turned the wheel on its side? Now instead of a wheel that crushes the peasants under its rim as great houses fight to be on top, now it is a merry-go-round that is driven by political machinations? A pretty courtly political dance far above the heads of the common folk?\n\nBecause I could buy that if they didn't skip over all the political dealings and ramifications.
It\u2019s an improvement from before, Rome wasn\u2019t built in one day. If they installed a democracy I would have shut off the tv before the episode ended. This takes place in medieval times. Democracy didn\u2019t come about until hundred of years later.. it\u2019s a process
They still do. \n\nA Stark is in charge with a Lannister and a Tarly serving on his council. The Greyjoys, Martell, Arryn and Baratheon families are all still in charge of their respective territory. On top of that, the Stark family is also in charge of their own independent kingdom. \n\nAll of these families will give their titles down through their families and no other way. Exception of this is the actual throne since Bran can't have an heir, so yeah, bloodshed awaiting.\n\nDon't give me the whole \"they did it for the realm\", Sam proposed an elective monarchy and it became clear that they laughed at the idea of letting go of their positions of power. They propped up one of theirs (member of a rich and powerful family) to assure the benefit of their own interests.
A big bad an episode, till no one is left but Tormund and Ghost, because they could never be big bads.
He was amazing in bodyguard

Thank you for this comment, really brought up my mood.
Damn Arya ruined pies for me, now thats the first thing I think about whenever someone mentions pies.
also possibly true, agreed
Maybe I sounded that way which was not my intention. I just wanted to point out that 1 is too unfair. Anyways, I agree with your main argument I should not generalize or try to guess people's reasoning. I am a bit sad about all the people involved and their effort.
if you got an average person and made them use more than about 40% of their attention to watch this series all the way through, you have to be borderline challenged to rate it a 7 or above. either that or you are a delusional peter pan child who thinks everything is wonderful and negativity is bad.
\"So Dorne and The Iron Islands don't want to secede despite Dorne being really high-up in authority, and Yara literally only joining Daenerys under the concession of independence?\"\n\n\"Huh, Arya killing Green Eyes didn't pan out huh?\" \n\n\"Bran Stark, the guy who didn't want to be Lord of Winterfell, hasn't had his powers explained and hasn't warged into anything or done anything of importance is now King and done nothing to earn it outside of being 'magical bait', which isn't even all his doing (NK marked him)? The guy who literally got carried everywhere cause of his bum legs?'\n\n\"Why does Tyrion get to talk and tell them choose a leader if he's a prisoner?\"\n\n\"So Jon's Targaryen ancestry boils down to riding Rhaegal in one battle, and fucking up his relationship with Daenerys? Not even a contender for the throne with no one battling to save him? Like he was stripped of his titles. He didn't even come up for nomination.\"\n\n\"Why did Drogon burn the throne and carry of Daenerys body?\"\n\n\"How did Bronn become Lord of Highgarden. How does a common cut-throat become leader over countless other houses when he doesn't know how to read or write.\"\n\n\"Why is there a Night's Watch, or was that a farce. Are Yara and Dorne angry and going to upkeep a watch on Jon, or is he literally okay if Greyworm fucks off? What is this.\"\n\n\"Greyworm, you're going to the place with flesh-eatting butterflies.\"\n\n\"So expanding on this; Tyrion basically fucks up everything for Daenerys, and then gets her killed and is now Hand of the King again? What a punishment. /s.  This is the guy who after realizing Varys was right commented how Varys was going to tell him 'I told you so', over 'Wow I killed my best friend over nothing.' How did Tyrion become fucking judge, jury, and executioner at his own trial.\"\n\n\"So I get the whole system change, which will still probably lead to fighting cause system changes do that, but Daenerys infertility was an issue, and Bran's is a virtue. Kinda an odd feeling juxtaposition. Nitpick here though.\"\n\n\"Arya trained with faceless assassins and only used her magical face skills ONE TIME in Westeros.  Not to kill Cersei, not against the Night King, not against Daenerys, not against Sansa or Littlefinger. Against Walder Frey and his house. Wow.\"\n\n\"Writing is a magical thing that can make anything work and be powerful. But tell me, do people believe in Jon and Daenery's romance?  Now let's say Jon tried to kill Daenerys but got detained by guards that Daenerys is missing in her scene for some reason. What if Jorah Mormont had lived and Daenerys had gone crazy? How would it have felt if Jorah had killed her instead? Died to dragonfire after?  That would've been fucking heartbreaking. And it would've totally killed the dumb [lover must kill lover] trope. Could even have Jon drop Longclaw. Jon and Daenery didn't have chemistry or the time to make it happen. Jorah and Daenerys did, eight seasons worth.\"
> you have to be borderline challenged to rate it a 7 or above\n\nBro, you had a chance to clarify it was an exaggeration, yet here you are doubling down and literally calling people borderline mentally challenged for liking this season.\n\nI'm going to assume there's not a single show or film that you like or think is good, otherwise I get to call you mentally challenged. See how this works?
mate it has 4 upvotes and every single reply is hating on it.
got technically worse by number... see any score for rt, imdb..lol
I mean he disappeared off into the wilderness where he will definitely be chopping trees down at some point. Too close to being a lumberjack for comfort.
Well, you feed people to dogs for fun so I don't know if I trust your opinion.
At least we dont practice incest
Right, but Dany's followers might have been cool with it if they found out Jon's true identity??? Guess we will never know...
you want a pat on the back for hating it? seems like most people on the sub do.
[deleted]
If you hated It so much why are you wasting your time discussing It on the internet with strangers. You didn\u2019t hate It, It just didn\u2019t meet the same standard of quality as seasons 1-5. \n\nI think everyone is confusing hate for the last season with disappointment.
It's true even if they downvote
Better than expected? Yes\n\nGood? Definitely not
Yeah i've been defending this show all season but the finale was indefensible imo i think they tried to curveball everyone but went too far
I do kinda see his point, and I've never even tried cocaine.
So you're saying more people really liked it than hated it? ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)
Ok but that is cherry picking to fit your narrative. Why did you not choose 1-2 and 9-10? Because it doesn't fit your narrative.
I ran the descriptive statistics on the data set and the distribution is negatively skewed. So that's not cherry picked data, and it does end up fitting my narrative. Happy?
That is not how numbers work. There are more 1s than 10s. Remove extremes and you get a 5.9. I'm not here arguing it was good, just the hypocrisy going around here.
... Read those sections
Oh, yeah. Definitely rushed.\n\nThe fact that the very things that drew me into the show (Whitewalkers) were decimated in a single episode was upsetting.
Fckin Bron. His plot was stupid and lazy as shit. Like Brienne and Tormund they just kept him around for fan service at the end. I hated it. \n\nCan't wait for Greyworm to die from the butterfly disease in Naarth.
Some of the conversations were very private, it's not like Littlefinger bugged the place
Thats just poor writing.
Well the Night's Watch doesn't actually exist anymore so I guess he's got nothing else to do. \nI mean there's a huge hole in the Wall and Jon literally told the Wildlings they're welcome to come thru anytime (not to mention there's only about a hundred of them left so)
I could believe that Drogon just turned his head and the throne was in the way. He didn't burn Jon because he smelt of Targyreon, the throne was the next thing in his sight. An accidental irony. There's so much stupid stuff much worse that I'm going to let them get away with this one.
I could maybe buy that but he charges up and hits it again to really smother it which makes that reading way too generous
Nothing bothers people on this sub. They probably don't see any problem in the *council* scene.

Yeah, this sub. What a bunch of mindless plebs who have no understanding of cinematic elements? \n\nI thumb my nose at these people.\n\n/s
Ah. Thanks.
Exactly. People dont know we had the finale spoilers for months. Except nobody believed them because it sounded terrible. We thought there was no way D&D would air such garbage on HBO
And having this idea out there will affect perception. As you realize the leaks are true you are thinking about that and your preformed judgment instead of just taking it in for the first time.
because it was
Does that mean you didn\u2019t like a single thing about this episode?
It was the first episode that I wanted to finish as fast as possible because I started to get bored and stop caring. Eventhough, I liked the first 20-30 minutes, the directing and ridiculous situations the characters got themselves in (Tyrion literally being able to exacavate his brother and sister...) just took me out of the episode. Also, the second part was HORRIBLE it felt like a comedy!
Episode was boring and no I didn\u2019t like a single thing about it
A Single thing wouldn\u2019t even grant a 1/10. a ninety minute episode that\u2019s close to perfect is a nine, but if I honestly enjoyed just about five minutes and thought the dragon looks cool that\u2019s not a five, is it? I think I rated it about 4 or 5, but after a couple of days i feel worse about it.
Well that\u2019s idiotic
I actually though episode 6 made episode 5 way better because it made Dany\u2019s \u201cmad\u201d moment a little more understandable, but that\u2019s just me I guess.
Awesome how her victory lasted 20 minutes at most right
[deleted]
I hated this season but good god you're like all the worst parts of the internet in a single person.
That's what is mind blowing.  Even fan fiction is so much better than what we got.
r/asoiafcirclejerk
Im serious
Jon became pretty great, until this season when he was basically a lackey.
Yeah I agree. Jon became obsessed with honor and brooding, Arya obsessed with being a bad ass, and Sansa with power.
Not like there\u2019s many excellent arguments on this sub anyways
Sleepy? \n\n  I dont even know what to respond to that.\n\n  No?\n  I mean sure scenes were clearly stretched, particularly the one in the throne room. But sleepy?
I dont care, at least I am happy GoT fanboy, and you are bitter
Aren't they the producers and writers of the show since day one, since eleven years?
You know there is a saga of books called *A song of ice and fire* right?
Yeah.. I\u2019m down with the ending. But like if your going to put a monotoned 17 year old, that displays absolutely no emotion, creeps out everyone he comes into contact with, in the highest seat of power, you gotta leave some breadcrumbs for the people. You. Just. Gotta. \n\nDany went mad fine. We could have gotta over that one. Bran the one true king? No, that\u2019s not gunna fly, we need answers.
I used to defend it thinking they had to get all their pieces in place to set up for season 8.  Turns out they rushed season 7 so they could rush season 8 and finish be done with it once and for all.
I fucking hate what they did with Bran. He has explicitly stated that he cannot be Lord of Winterfell because he is the Three Eyed Raven now. He even said he\u2019s not even really a man. He made a bid deal about telling Jon his true heritage. Now all the sudden he wants to be King? He probably knew exactly what was going to happen with Danaerys and he said nothing. Fuck Bran and fuck these terrible writers.
If he had known, I wouldn\u2019t even be pissed. I mean if they spent the season showing bits that didn\u2019t make sense and left you questioning what bran was doing for it all to be revealed at the end. That may have possibly been good. But he was basically useless these past 2 seasons.
> He probably knew exactly what was going to happen with Danaerys and he said nothing. Fuck Bran and fuck these terrible writers.\n\nI think that's implied pretty heavily with the dragon vision over King's Landing back season 6 or whatever it was. But yeah that almost means that Bran/3ER was the ultimate villain in the end. They let everything happen or even nudged small things to make it happen just so the 3ER could become king. Really not sure if i'm a big fan of that
They completely fucked up so many characters. Bran, Danerys, Euron (was a great character that they wasted) Cersei, Arya. The only person that D+D actually gave a good story arch is Theon.\nThey should have done a lot more with Bran, and Euron honestly.
He lied. And, he's not Bran.  They all got outmaneuvered by Bloodraven
Literally said he didn't want to be king to Tyrion as it happened.
Isn't Bran on the throne presumably how GRRM told them it would end though?
To be fair, had he said something, someone would have tried to kill her meaning Cersei would have won, or should the killing be unsuccessful Dany would have done it anyways.
A very strange piece of writing, imo. Could nearly end up with Bran being viewed as a sort of Machiavellian figure, which I'm not sure was the writers' intention, but just illustrates how poorly executed the whole thing was..
I viewed the whole thing differently. He didn't want to be king, but since he's the three eyed raven he already knew that he would become king, so he did it to fulfill his destinay. Why was he chosen? Well that's sort of a paradox
I'd be interested to see a one off feature length episode showing what Westeros looks like in 100 years. With Bran being so passive and allowing so many disasters to happen, it would be interesting to see what he's like as a king. It would probably be like a HP Lovectaft story - eldritch being tricks everyone into making him king and goes on to turn his kingdom into a dystopian nightmare.
Where was the objection on religious grounds? Ebrose was writing a book but he wasn't at a grand council? Jim Broadbent didn't want to come back for one scene?\n\nHow can the septons have a different religion than the king without massive dissonance?
He doesn't want to be a king, but it was his responsibility to become one.\nBrans journey was to become a king which will lead Westeros to prosperity. He can see all previous king choices and consequences. He can see what happens in the world. And if he manages to grow weirwood, then he will be able to live long enough to give away his title for democracy.
Bran will be king in the books too.
Fucking writers!
Bran is very likely going to be king in the Books too. You calling GRRM terrible too?
Poorly written
That really grinds my gears. Literally 4 episodes before that he was talking about how he doesn\u2019t want to be Lord of anything. I feel like that was intentional misdirect by the writers, who again went for shock value versus logic
Plot twist. Bran/The Three eyed Raven learns to warg into Drogon and now that he has control of The Prince That Was Promised/The Stallion Who Mounts the World, cleanses the world by setting it afire, in the name of the Lord of Light. The Night King never wanted to end humanity. He wanted to stop the Three Eyed Raven from going on a rampage. People kept getting in the way, damnit!\n\nSEASON 9 CONFIRMED! GET HYPE!
Fantastic. You\u2019re hired
*\"One side's villain is the other side's hero.\"*
I still think they meant it as an upbeat line from him. I bet they just wanted to convey that he came all the way from kings landing, but the implication to the audience is that his whole journey and everything the realms went through was to get him on the throne.\n\nAnother victim of writing. Unless they intended it to make people think. Which could be the case, but than I'd argue they fumbled that. Cause it just warrants a \"H\u00e9? What the fuck?\"
I dunno, to me the line \"Why do you think I came all this way?\" implies prior knowledge. And he shouldn't be joking anymore anyways because he doesn't feel and isn't Bran anymore. Or is he? We will never know, because it flips and flops back and forth.
They clearly didn\u2019t realize how it sounded/looked in context\n\nNo surprise cause they suck
He said is like a sitcom joke. And then everyone chuckled, like, \"oh, Bran.\" The show acted like it was a funny aside, and didn't seem to understand the chilling implications of this statement.
It doesn\u2019t really matter either way tho, the implication is still the same that he knew he was going to be chosen.
As I said countless times since this \"sh\\*t\" happened, Bran was either the true villain of the story or a f\\*cking nobody that shouldn't get the throne/didn't deserve the throne (because of horrible character arc and lack of any personal connection to the throne).
>  bet they just wanted to convey that he came all the way from kings landing\n\nI really don't think this was what they were going for. It sounded like a *Everthing I did since season 6 was for this*
I heard that line and thought what you thought they intended, not the entire path of everything he's done.
You make great points about Bran, but everything you\u2019ve said is all examples that Brandon Stark did die when he became the 3ER.  We\u2019re still left trying to understand what the 3ER wanted exactly,  but it\u2019s safe to say he was after the Throne. He can see all possible futures and what better way to possibly end up on the Throne than through a Stark.  Is he a villain that just wants control or did the 3ER want to end tyranny as well? I do wish the story could have filled in the missing pieces,  but I think the first step in understanding it is that Bran is not sitting on the Throne it is the 3ER.
Yeah one of my biggest issues was not giving a single fuck about White Walker/CotF/3ER lore in the final two seasons
At least in the books, Bran is turning into a monster.  Jon, who has powers in the books, gets a lesson that basically amounts to a lesson in how to not be an evil wizard.  Bran is checking every box.  What he does to Hodor is an abomination in the books and pretty explicitly meant to be magical rape.  Bran knows it is wrong but does it constantly because it makes him feel good.  There are also worrying signs that he may be about to use Hodor to rape Meera.  He has also eaten human flesh both with his own hands and through his wolf.  Incidentally, Arya also murdered and ate a shepperd while dreaming in her wolf.
End tyranny after possibly manipulating Dany into killing everyone and giving access to the NK? LUL better luck next King :P In my opinion, he is the true villain of the story. Him and Dumb&Dumber. *So many plot holes :'(*
Why would Tyrion even back him!
I think we are absolutely led to believe that Bran's \"I don't want\" is sincere and that Varys (?) saying the best king is one who doesn't want it is a correct assessment. The end of the series is showing us the dawn of a new era and I think we are meant to believe in and embrace it. The king is innocent and all-knowing, the council is (with the exception of Bronn) made of people who only want the best for everyone, and the hereditary line of kingship is gone (which is what caused all this trouble in the first place.) I think theorizing that the 3ER was somehow a villain seizing control for nefarious purposes can be interesting but ultimately doesn't seem supported by anything and is not how we're supposed to interpret that ending. We can take this point at face-value.
I think Bran's arc never happened in the last seasons. He is not a mastermind strategist, he is someone who can see every moment happened in the past. Bran arc stopped with \"Hold the Door\" becoming the three eyes raven, a no human who has no interest in the humanity politics and only to preserve the world, nature and the order of things. Then, in episode 6 season 8 that status jumped directly to mastermind strategist who was always playing the game of the throne. There has been no arc, no sense, the directors didn't make bran develop into that direction. Seems like they just picked the one who was less likely to become king to shock audience because GoT always shocked audience, they thoight they could recreate shock as for example the \"Red Wedding\" did. \n\nOr maybe it was their goal since the start but they still wrote it awfully and this happened because they needed to rush it. They had 2 years to shoot so much footage and they even ended to waste those years by not being able to put those scenes together. \n\nFantastic acting. Fantastic CGI. Beautiful scenes if picked one by one. But it was all rushed, there is no real timeline between scenes they are just glued together. Lots of fanservice and Disney-like forced things. The ending season that a well written show like GoT  didn't deserve
His character had the most potential, I honestly hate how rushed this season was.
It seemed that him and Sansa manipulated Jon to get rid of Daenerys, take the fall, and allow both of them to get into power. At least that's the way the show presented it. \n\nBran gets to be King. \n\nSansa gets to rule an independent North. \n\nJon gets to...go live in Alabama
Aka the bransa conspiracy.
Bran's whole character has been terribly handled. Turned into an emotionless robot in the last 2 seasons, zero build up towards him becoming King and no real role in the WW arc & explaining his powers.\n\nAnd then they expected people to be ok with him becoming King and giving him lines like that? WTF
While I agree that it was a mediocre arc, I don't understand where you're getting this \"he neglected to do anything because he wanted power\" thing. He's reacted to every situation the same; He's never made an attempt to influence results in any way and he always tells people that they were where they were supposed to be regardless of the \"good\" or \"evil\" aspects about it. This felt like the same thing to me. Of course he knows when bad things are going to happen, but he's never attempted to prevent or help with one of them before, I don't understand why people expected him to all of a sudden.
Yeah and we never heard from Meera again. Like what was the point of that journey? What would Meera think about him being the fucking King.
He just fucking dumps Meera with next to no emotion and people still think this emotionless robot should be King.
I hate bran, completely not thrilled about him getting the throne. But I truly don't believe Bran played everyone to get throne. Martin's end game was for someone who does not process any desire for power, greed, and vengeance to sit on the throne. Bran is the only one who fits that category. However, its hard to say for certain because the writers did such a shitty job with Bran's character, we have no idea wtf is actually going on inside his head. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvidence to support Bran's complete loss of any \"wants\" as he described it to Tyrion is his convo with Jaime in the Godswood. Jaime asked why he didn't tell everyone the truth about his fall. Bran replied \"you won't be able to help in this fight if I let them murder you\". Bran has no desire for justice or vengeance for what was done to him. Therefore his decision making process is one that completely lacks all personal desires. Which often corrupts the mind. \n\nJaime being sentenced to death for his crimes against Bran would have been just for the starks and bran but not necessarily the benefit to the realm at that time.
He's been manipulating events the entire time most likely...they just cut the show waaaay to short to go into those details.
There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever Bran has been manipulating anything outside of his throwaway \u201cshy do you think I came all this way\u201d line. I agree he *could* be manipulating things, but that is never remotely explained or developed upon
Bran is actually just Littlefinger. Littlefinger became a faceless man ya know? Bet your expectations are subverted
I like to think when he yelled \"FATHER!\" at the Tower of Joy, it gave Ned the idea to adopt Jon.
Especially from a character who doesn't consider himself human anymore and has said he doesn't want.
Imagine, creating a genius of evil w/o realising it. I knew they were bad but this... This is next lvl. Its so baaaaad its almost art
What's sinister about it? He repeated that he doesn't want to be King 2 minutes later. He came all this way because he knew he would be chosen and was willing to take on that responsibility, that's all.
\n> What's sinister about it?\n\nBecause it briefly implies he was manipulating events the entire time.  \n\n> He came all this way because he knew he would be chosen and was willing to take on that responsibility, that's all.  \n\nSo lets ignore the fact his election makes less sense than the tuxedo football scene in *The Room* - The question everyone should be asking is Why? Why is he willing to take on this responsibility? His whole point was that he was not Bran Stark anymore and that he wouldn\u2019t be the lord or ruler of anything? Why does Bran give a shit? His whole plotline has been *explicitly* about the great threat of the NK and how \u201conly he can stop them\u201d. He has never been involved with the KL storyline and his character has never had anything to do with either wanting to rule the kingdoms (like Dany) or being elected to positions of power (like Jon).  \n\nI *guess* you could make the argument that was the point and the kingdoms needed and desired a different kind of ruler but that also makes no sense because 1) hardly anybody in the dragonpit meeting even knew who Bran was, let alone what the 3ER is, and 2) the thematic principles of S8 (as awful as they were) is that development doesn\u2019t really matter and you just end up back where you started. But this theme is also kicked out the window at the end (or at least that was the intention) with Bran as king (which made no sense) and a mostly low-born small council (which also made no sense).  \n\nI just don\u2019t get the point of Bran or the point of the final message? I guess the point of the final message is inherent impossible to grasp because the *how* of the final message makes no sense, but the purpose of Bran could\u2019ve at least been explained - but nope, we don\u2019t even get a tiny bit of explanation into Bran\u2019s ultimate motives
\"WE\" still don't know fuck all about Bran...\n\nThat's such a huge assumption by people who don't know much about the show...\n\nIf you know everything about time and space- if you have cosmic knowledge, all of reality is spoiled for you.  You'll always know where to be and when to be.  It's the point of the 3 Eyed Raven.  He is ALL history All memories and all knowing... He's lost all enjoyment and excitement of life because he knows EVERYTHING.\n\nThis is why he never moved when the Night King was approaching him.  He knows Arya will kill him.  He's not Bran, he's the 4th wall breaking viewer of the series.  Imagine being told ALL of the story of Game of Thrones--Now you're a character in the story.  You'd always know where to be, what to do, etc.\n\nJust because you don't comprehend a story doesn't mean your ignorance gets to be the deciding factor in something.\n\nYou. Know. Nothing.
Well I liked most of the arcs, even Brans for the most part
Wanting the throne and deserving the throne are very clearly shown as two separate things throughout the season. Bran isn\u2019t saying he came all this way because he wanted the throne the whole time, he came all this way cause he wants what\u2019s best for the realm and that\u2019s him being king
Okay fair point. But Bran has never shown any qualities that in the eyes of 99% of Westeros' inhabitants would make him deserving of throne
~~It's so 2000s action movie ending line~~ \n\nIt's so 2000s *straight-to-DVD* action movie ending line
It\u2019s so 2000 *made-for-tv* movie ending line
Obviously because he sees it as his duty and \"what must happen\" according to his knowledge. That doesn't mean he wants it ??? Yes the script was really bad at times, but so is this complaint
>letting hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians die\n\nThis implies that he could have done anything about it to  begin with. Do please tell. How could Bran have stopped any of those events from unfolding? Not defending the show, cuz it turned to shit, but this seems unfounded.
Bran didn't have to tell Jon about his true heritage. Also since Bran can probably see glimpses of the future, and also has infinite knowledge of the past why didn't he tell Dany to use the secrete passageway which Jaime used to send some elite soldiers to go kill Cersei? Not to mention Bran would know that Euron had equipped his fleet with a whole boat load of scorpions and could have saved her dragon. It looks to me like he subtly manipulated events to go his way, even though Dumb and Dumber probably didn't intend for that to be the case
And he even insisted multiple times before when others pointed out that he was the rightful Lord of Winterfell that the 3 Eyed Raven can't be a Lord.
Exactly
They apparently cut a scene that showed exactly that Arya or Sansa and Bran conversation.
I thought that him becoming the 3ER so quickly basically fried is brain in a way. Since he really wasn't ready to be the 3ER. Maybe the OG was ready. Idk, just how I interpreted it I guess.
This is how I see it. I mean, he was pushed to become the 3ER too soon because of his own mistake of letting the Night King touch him in his vision. Then, his most loyal friend (Hodor) had to be sacrificed so he could survive - and Bran was the reason he talked like a Pok\u00e9mon. Robo-Bran seemed to be more like a coping mechanism than a side effect of being the 3ER
That's what I thought too, but I think they should've just made him be like that for the rest of season 6 and the first bit of season 7, give him some time to come back to normal and have actual character development.  After all, he was still emotional when he plugged into the tree and learned about Jon when telling Meera \"I'm the three eyed raven now, I have to do this.\"\n\nBut then after that he's just \"beep boop \ud83d\udcdf \ud83e\udd16\". Pretty much ruined his character making him so boring and truly a disservice to Isaac H. Wright by giving nothing interesting to do for the rest of the series.
I think part of it is that the character is a lot harder to translate from book to screen than others. I think the showrunners lost investment in the story and they ended up not doing the work to translate the character well, so we got stuck with robo-Bran. Idk still stupid.
Or Moonboy for all I care. No way to learn that given the question that was asked.
I think it's safe to presume that Bran is nowhere near 'second-favorite Stark'.
oh!
Vegisexual
It's spelled vedgetabel, right?
Agreed, Ned was a great character. He really was the one to get everything rolling.\n\nSansa is also pretty aight, wish she had done anything in season 8 like actually contesting Dany after she murdered Kings Landing, probably would have made her my favorite.\n\nThe other Starks are aight to meh,\nJon and Arya are just huge Mary Sues with a shit ton of plot armor and both were kinda ruined by season 8. \nCait had less depth when compared to the books. \nRob has always been a rather minor character. \nRickon is a joke.\nBran is straight up a huge plot hole.
I think she needed to spell it out for Jon as he seemed to be a bit slow in season 8.
SHE IS MAH KWEEN
It's like he knows nothing
First rule of great screen-writing (by D&D): tell, don't show.
She also spent 8 out of 8 seasons murdering various people, but sharp catch by Arya there.
That was horrific writing. My friend and I actually laughed \u201clike no shit she\u2019s a genocidal maniac not a killer.\u201d
What did you expect? Good dialogue from the writers? Haven\u2019t you heard? They got better things to do now...
>Yeah and dany was insane, Jon was stupid, Geoffrey cruel, Tommen weak, Tywin ruthless.  Each characters qualities whether they be likable or not contributed to this amazing story.\n\nThank you! I never got the hate for Catelyn. She wasn't one of my favourites, but I really liked her. I don't know. Did she have some irritating moments? Yeah. And as you said, SO DO ALL THE CHARACTERS. Even Jon, for fuck's sake. And I don't see as much hate in those cases lol
dunno, she was irredeemable for me. Acted like a cunt towards Jon who didn't do anything and then betrayed Robb by releasing Jaime like a stupid cunt
So he has 1 thing to Bran at least since he could walk. That's good to know :P
The S7 and S8 trope of Tyrion blindly trusting Cersei at every turn just made no sense whatsoever. The dude knows better than anyone that she's a back-stabbing bitch mainly out for herself. What the hell made him think that she would risk thousands of her soldiers when she instead had the opportunity to have Daenerys Targaryen and her entire forces obliterated?\n\nThen again, her being back-stabbing also changes depending on whether it's convenient for the plot. She sends Bronn to have Tyrion executed with the same crossbow he killed Tywin with, but for some reason no one has explained to me yet, she doesn't immediately kill him, Dany and her advisors or Drogon when they're all in range for the dozens of scorpion bolts ready to fire at them at Missandei's execution.
Tyrion as a character had to explain the poor writing every time he said \"I made a mistake. I shouldn't have trusted Cersei. I thought she had something to fight for.\"
She tried to kill him. Did he forget? Like dafuq? That whole thing was huge and made him hate everyone in KL.
Cersei kind of forgot she wanted to kill Tyrion.
It's probably because she let Tyrion know that she is pregnant. Anyone watching the show knows that Cersei is COMPLETELY driven by her children.  \n\nWhether Cersei thought the NK would actually get to Kings Landing or not, Tyrion thought that she wouldn't risk letting her child be destroyed by the WW.
I think Tyrion's plan was to get the throne at the end. He was playing Machiavelli. I mean, why snitch on Varys? It seems like he was manipulating people to turn on each other except his siblings. If this is the case, the director failed horribly at portraying this. It just doesn't make any sense how the characters acted so stupidly in the end compared to the early seasons.
That entire fucking episode of \u2018walk and talk for 20 steps, then stop and poignantly look into the distance,\u2019 was such bullshit. People loved it at the time however.
It was pointless at the time, but I kept holding out hope that there would be some payoff down the line... But no...
The annoying thing is they didn't even need a Dragon to cross the wall. They could just walk around the pass on the western side of it.
>It was pretty clear that the writers knew they wanted the NK to have a dragon.\n\nIf they only wanted NK to have a dragon they could have found a dead *somewhere* for him to raise.
>Cersei made it seems like she would be convinced?\n\nRemind me to murder the inventor of the withheld information trope. And the [Unspoken Plan Guarantee](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee) trope. I hate them with a vengeance and classify them as \"How to give dramatic revelations a half-hearted attempt by being vague.\"
If you think about it these  guys are rich and all they have to do is find a creative way to give the NK a dragon.\nAnd thats what they come up with.
I'd say losing only half your forces against a neverending army of the undead is a pretty good score.
This will also happen
Maybe add some rank-order questions instead of absolute or check all that apply questions. \n\nFor worst decision, maybe have us rank order a list, e.g., (1. Jon et al trying to capture a wight 2. Ned trusting little finger/warning Cersei beforehand 3. Dany listening to Tyrion about Cersei/not going off to burn the iron fleet/not attacking KL/anything 4. Queen Cersei choosing to not have at least one child by Bobby B 5. Robb agreeing to marry a Frey girl and then reneging 6. Oberyn not finishing off the Mountain/standing too close while interrogating him) \n\nDefinitely re-ask the who should\u2019ve died question with almost all of the characters sill alive (J, S, A, B, T, ST, G, P, Bron, BoT) and use rank-order. Same with who do you wish had lived longer or to the end. \n\nFor rank-order Qs you can analyze them by assigning point values for each rank then averaging across users: 1=10 pts, 2=9 pts ... (or how ever many options you list 1=5 pts, 2=4 pts). \n\nGreat job on these btw!
The idea of starting a rewatch and knowing that is going to be the end just puts me off.
Ah, I was saying that because almost none of the characters got the ending in his arc. For example, all the scenes of Arya being obsessed with Cersei, all the scenes of the NK vs Jon Snow stare-off, etc. They have no meaning in the \"end game\", so I lost my interest to all of them.
I just think he\u2019s so honorable he wont go back to Winterfell just to show he accepts the decision. Which is completely stupid. Futhermore, they dont need a nights watch anymore.
Right? The white walkers are dead and the wildlings are friends, what the fuck are they guarding against now?
That's the point I think
Yes Sansa is a Queen and can pardon him or give him sanctuary
Everyone seems to miss the fact that the whole point of this was to break the wheel and that can't be done by going back on deals. Jon is exiled. If he just goes to chill at Winterfell and Dany's remnant finds out, they march on Winterfell. The Ironborn join them. Does Bran, who isn't even Bran, send his armies to aid his family, even though they subverted an official sentence? Would that not make them enemies of Kings Landing? Bran won't give a shit but the other Lords might not appreciate the North having free reign to do whatever they want.\n\nKeeping Jon in exile, while sucky, blocks events that could spiral into new wars, and then where the fuck are we? Right back to the Game.
That works well if all of Danny's remaining supporters weren't on a boat heading for Naath before Jon even left king's landing
Yeah but D&D are going to subvert expectations and ruin it *more*
Honestly? I think Star Wars would be perfect for them. They chose cisual spectacles over story this season on Thrones, and I think that would suit Star Wars fairly well
It was interesting until he returned to castle black. From that point forward he just sat around doing nothing except saying something creepy once an episode.
Meera fans represent.
Osha as well
Why were they not at the council along with whatever lady is currently head of house Frey, and all the other nobles houses
I agree the end of Bran's story was dumb and pointless, but his journey has been the most interesting and intriguing to me through out the show - just to show a different opinion
Honestly, it always bored me personally - I just didn't find it or him interesting, and when he came back after being absent from Season 5 I just didn't care at all anymore.
Seriously, it's like that in Itchy and Scratchy episode 2F09, when Itchy plays Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone, he strikes the same rib in succession, yet he produces two clearly different tones. I mean, what are we to believe, that this is a magic xylophone, or something? Ha ha, boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.
I guess it\u2019s just me, but I read that as \u201che came all this way\u201d because he knew he had to be king in order to \u201cbreak the wheel\u201d. Idk maybe I\u2019m giving them too much credit, but I actually like the Bran on the throne decision. What I can\u2019t agree with, is the lack of a natural storyline to get there. Like they should\u2019ve shown Bran using his powers to make correct decisions about some events between him becoming the 3ER and now, to at least give a viable reason for him being a good king. Instead he was just cryptic as shit and confirmed R+L=J, and that\u2019s pretty much it.
They've already said no spinoffs with the current characters. I think arya exploring west would be pretty shitty honestly.
Well no. That was the thing. He originally wouldn't do it, but Varys convinces him:\r\r> What about the lives of your children, my lord? Is that a precious thing to you?\r\rYes, he's leaving his kids. But presumably they would be with the Lannisters, which obviously that's better than them being dead. (For all Ned knows, they could be tortured or killed if he doesn't give a confession)\r\rAlso Cat and Robb are still alive, so they could hopefully get the kids back at some point.
That's why he finally choose to recognize king Joffrey as the true king, before getting his head chopped off anyway. Which makes his end even more tragic, frustrating and schoking. They break him, and he accepts his entire life of honor to be destroyed, for nothing.

Then why was everything green and full of green grass and trees when they showed the scene of the night king's creation. That was \"beyond the wall\" as well. (the wall wasnt technically there yet but the location is north of the soon to be built wall)
I mean basic story telling, if you read, watch or write a story and the first reaction to something that happens is \"wow thats kinda dumb, why wouldn't they just do/say ______\" then its bad writing. \n\nLike with the battle of winterfell, did they make the battle plan by our heros stupid because otherwise it would have seemed like the night king and his army wasn't that strong? if thats the case make the battle plan by our heros water tight, have it on paper so that by all accounts they should win the fight, then just make the night king that much more that even the best plan is nothing compared to him, they spent 7 seasons building up how the nk and his army are the unstoppable death of the world so there was no risk of him seeming \"to strong\" that was the point.
> \"This is a fantasy series with dragons and magic, it doesn't have to make sense!\"   \n\nIn other words, \u201cJust don\u2019t think about it\u201d
That argument is exceptionally stupid for Game of Thrones, because what the series has always excelled at is that even in a world with magic and heroes and prophecies that really come true, *the politics make sense.*
I wish they never chose D&D in the first place, i knew it was inevitable that they'd fuck it up, cause i don't think anyone had ever heard of Dan Weiss before GoT, looking at his IMDB page and it's completely empty other than very very small projects. And Benioff made that Wolverine Origins movie which was horrible. I wish they'd grab someone like Guillermo del Toro, cause i think around the time they cancelled him for The Hobbit, they were starting to make GoT.
Yeah, seriously, you could make the same argument for Marvel movies which basically have what amounts to magic and fantastic creatures.
Someone fetch the westeros stretcher
Nah, the main characters just learned Instant Transmission from Goku.
[deleted]
Wasn't that during Robert's Rebellion?
And when she asked if he could forgive him he didn't even respond
Maybe if you just throw a bunch of symbols together it will mean something?
I swear the writers were purposely fucking with us.
That\u2019s what makes Bran being king so intriguing and why it\u2019ll probably be done much better if ADOS ever comes out. Before with the Night King you could justify Bran\u2019s letting everything happen like Theon\u2019s death because it all culminated with the killing blow that saved Westeros. And now he\u2019s probably let thousands die to become King, which was never even close to being part of his story, and yet all that time spent with the 3ER that we didn\u2019t get to see had to have been about becoming King. I really hope the prequels delve into this stuff more because it seemed like the end of GoT was a victory for the 3ER alone; Bran becoming King had to have been decades in the making, plus some evil 3ER\u2019s would be dope.
Dany is killing innocents because SHE thinks it\u2019s needed for her kind of \u201cgood\u201d; and she was gonna kill millions of others in order to reach her goal. But with Bran letting her kill those millions and setting up the distrust in her in the first place, he assured that she would be killed and couldnt kill more. I guess people see it as \u201che caused Dany to kill a million\u201d but I see it more as a \u201che made sure she couldnt kill MORE than a million\u201d. You could say that he couldve tried to make it so she wouldnt kill a million in the first place, but maybe this was the only way to reduce her kills while also breaking the wheel for the a better distant future.\n\nTotally agree, there really isnt a good, right proper answer, at least until the books!
That stills has the implication that Dany was *right* to torch King's Landing though, if that was the best future from Bran's perspective
The visions are somewhat unclear, but I don't think he can scan the future and act to change it. He only ever acknowledges the fact that events happen because they *have* to. He gives meaning to what happens a posteriori, but he doesn't act to change it in advance (because he can't really know what will happen).
He already manipulated events with Hodor. It's obviously possible.
Or the first responses could've been Bran lying. \n\nIf the 3ER were lying in the end, he'd have no reason to have told the truth in the beginning in the first place. I think it's more plausible that he's been telling the truth the whole time.
The future may not have been changed by Jon\u2019s choice. If Jon had not said anything there is no guarantee Jon\u2019s heritage could not have been found out a different way. Maybe Sam decides he needs to tell someone for revenge? Maybe Tyrion over hears Dany and Jon discussing it? The fact that Jon did spill his secret was a betrayal to Dany which escalated her \u201cmadness\u201d, but it still could have played out the same. The news gets leaked without Jon making the choice,  but Dany feels unloved because the people love Jon. Jon stepped back from Dany the moment he learned of his heritage and I believe that hurt Dany as much as him spilling the news. She chose fear when Jon refused her love. She still lost people close to her which also played into her reaction at KL.
He can't see the future, he only knows that things move in a deterministic way and that whatever happens is what *has* to happen. This has always been his attitude since becoming the 3ER. He doesn't push for things to happen, he just acknowledges that there is only one way they could have happened.
First Bran can't see the future, he can only see visions, out of context scenes that may happen, but the show does a really poor job explaining us what his powers are so I really can't blame you\n\n\nSecondly, do you have a girlfriend? Imagine you have done something bad and your best friend comes over \"TacoMagic it's your choice if you want to tell her what you did\"\n\n\nIs there any possible outcome where you don't tell her and don't spend the night on the couch?
So he's afflicted by visions... of the future... that don't make any sense and he can't do anything with... sounds like a fun ability to have... like a stroke jumping tv channels that he can share with others but it ultimately means nothing because the ink is dry... hurray...\n\nI would not conflate to \"Jon knowing his true identity\" and then telling his immediate family, the thing he literally just said he was going to do.. as \"hiding something from my girlfriend she eventually finds out and I sleep on a couch\" ?\n\n\"Why do you think I came all this way\"\n\n\"It's your choice\" \n\n3EyeRaven playing these fools.
He coulda told arya about the fate of kings landing if he knew, arya would believe him cuz he knew of her list, sansa knows of her faces, and believes bran has \"visions\". Arya could just assassinate danny wearing a face of anyone. Hell danny called her hero of winter fell, she sees arya as no threat to her life anyways even if word gets to her of aryas powers.\n\nIf bran knew and didnt get arya to kill her first.. that to me is weird logic
Really? I\u2019m like the complete opposite. Even as a kid, I was rooting for James Bond to die in Goldeneye just because I liked Sean Bean as 006 so much.
>006\n\n007*\n\nEdit: I apparently need to relearn how to read. Ignore me.
Rob and Jon were boy scouts, too.
Oh I must have missed how they counted every variation of every word.
Personally I don\u2019t expect OP to pay for a program to do something that is not necessary. I don\u2019t know about you
I mean if I'm planning to analyze >100k qualitative data points I would. Although I'm sure there are open source alternatives that can do this.
It deserves as many upvotes as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had nobles.
And it died at the hands of a Frenchman of all things...
    it had a degree of religious tolerance that was missing from England, Spain and France\n\nYou're joking, right? The 30 year's war didn't happen? And the only reason it didn't kick off much sooner was because the HRE was not a state but a loose federation.
You will note how I qualified that in the statement you are replying to and then realize why your response is missing the point.
If Bran is immortal, why was he worried about the NK killing him?
I think he meant to say that Bran can't die of age, so he would live forever if not killed. Personaly, i don't subscribe to that theory, cause the previous three eyed raven only lived that long by merging with a weirwood tree. I doubt that's a possibility for bran as king.
Because the writers wrote that. It doesn\u2019t make sense just because it was written. Why would the white walkers target Wikipedia instead of the A10 Warthogs? Just because Bran was worried, it doesn\u2019t mean it was justified. Out of all the things that don\u2019t make any sense, Bran being worried about dying doesn\u2019t really rank high up the list.
Immortal\u2260Invincible.
That's 4 years old, and it is exactly my point.   \n\nThis season,  she just repeats it like a catch phrase, and it certainly doesn't mean what it did in that clip.  She used it a chant to fire up her army to go and conquer all known lands.\n\n\"Daeny kinda forgot what 'break the wheel' meant.  But the wheel didn't forget about her.\"  if I can be allowed to meme about it.
D&D realized that Dany breaking the wheel was a little too sympathetic because *almost every other character on the show* wants to keep the wheel regardless of their sympathetic perspectives.\n\nIt would literally become Dany versus everyone. Which would be entertaining as all hell, but it would also mean half, if not most, of the audience would find themselves rooting for Dany against the entire Stark family. Which would also be incredibly entertaining but hard to write around.\n\nBasically, the Great Houses are the wheel. How do you write a show where all of the good guys support a horrible system that only one or two of the good guys want to tear down? D&D broke in favor of a fucked-up system that likeable characters mindlessly support instead of a morally grey and sometimes divisive character tearing down the fucked up system that the likeable characters mindlessly support.\n\nWhich is why Tyrion straight-up lies at the end and says that Dany's dream was to make sure the spokes on the wheel stay intact.
Yet people wanted to name the episode \"The Broken Wheel\".  Sorry but to me that's a horrendous name, even with any sort of context, purely for the sake of #***SYMBOLISM***
~#Hashtag~
> That's what I call \"breaking the wheel\", at least in the world of ASOIAF.\n\nno, no no no, no. not at all.\n\nWhat you described is her being a spoke in the wheel, exactly.  And when she dies and has no kid, yet another succession war breaks out between everyone.  The wheel turns once more,  and the people suffer for it.\n\nWhat you describe is exactly the wheel, and Daeny keeps the wheel going full force.\n\nObviously,  breaking the wheel is a democracy/republic and a peaceful transition of power.   No more rights to the throne, no more birthright, no more 'name',  but replaced with people peacefully voting to elect a leader whose job is to serve the realm.  The exact opposite of Daeny and the \"Conquer the World\" message from the latest episode.
We've had medieval kings who specifically took power away from nobles and empowered commoners precisely because the nobles held enough land and wealth collectively to challenge them. Dany's plan wasn't anachronistic, and giving nobles the power to choose their king has more often than not led to more conflict than disempowering them.\n\nThe interesting thing is that a perfect situation for this is a character like Dany who can't follow hereditary succession. She wouldn't want power to be passed down generationally, especially given her experience with corrupt and bloodthirsty Targs and Lannisters.
You could see in his face that he didn\u2019t really mean those things. He was in a tough spot and really wanted her to be good but you can see the anguish in his face while saying those lines to Tyrion. He was having an internal battle of \u201clove vs duty\u201d He wanted her to be his queen and be good so bad that he was trying to convince himself that she was and at the end of the day he knew what had to be done. Sometimes when it\u2019s something that you want so bad but you know is wrong, you need some outside perspective to make the right choice. It\u2019s just like a lot of real relationships when you know you shouldn\u2019t go back with your ex but you do anyways. Jon just needed a friend to put it in perspective because he was blinded by love
That's the problem none of what you said is believable. That scene should feel like that but it just reads like a mix of stupidity and a little of bit of loyalty. Very uncharacteristic, and all to quickly push towards a quick resolution.\n\nJon was made stupid in general and they forced in an unbelievable love/loyalty to fill in any remaining games. He was just a tool to push certain plot points and ultimately made him useless wood as a character.
I agree but 51% did not
I was angry about the ending at first because It didn\u2019t make sense due to how rushed it was. But once I connected the dots through all the recaps and cast interviews I was able to make sense of It all and think It was a good ending. It was just executed absolutely terribly.
Yeah he did say that didn't he. The realm is so screwed
I was running under the assumption that Bran has forfeitted his claim on the North.  \n\nAlso Sansa was Lady of Winterfell when she declared independence, which made her Queen regardless.
It's been going on longer than that.
The lord of light wanted Danny dead?
Nah, he wanted Dany to help. Dany dying would only happen when the Lord of Light \"fucks off\".
would he have needed to be killed like that if Jon's plan hadn't given him the GD dragon in the first place?
Why is such a sensible post buried in this thread? It baffles me that there\u2019s so many people who failed to realize Jon\u2019s entire purpose and why he had to be a half Targ.
Thank you, it\u2019s been hard to find others who agree
Nah I don\u2019t see it that way, he was brought back to bring dany into the fold to defeat the night king and the kill dany before she become too powerful. He purpose was always to kill dany, and to help the defeat the NK not necessarily to kill him himself. When Melisandre goes to dragon stone she said to dany, you and the king in the north both have a role in this war. Danys purpose was served when the NK was defeated. It was only Jon left with one more purpose, kill dany.
Within the show, sure. But of course that raises the question of why the lord of light gives a flying fuck about Dany being alive/dead.
Except the night king got past the wall much faster with the dragon, Dany would probably have time to beat Cersei and take the kingdom pretty fast (even the North had Jon stayed dead). Also, the nk dying the way he died could have happened anywhere, anytime. Bran could have just seeked Arya, waited for a bit for him to show up, and have her ninja her way into killing him.
You think Arya/Sansa/anyone in the North is okay with Dany taking Winterfell? Dany probably kills all the Starks as she burns Winterfell down. The only reason that fight against the dead is close is because of the unity between Dany\u2019s forces and Jon\u2019s forces. Without him the Night King would find a way to win.\n\nAnd, again, even if this wasn\u2019t true. The Red god is a cruel one. It doesn\u2019t *need* to narratively pay off any more than Robb being the king in the north was
Nope. Drogon obviously showed interest in jon in multiple scenes in s7 and 8.
He looked at Jon a few times, therefore Drogon wouldn't kill the person that killed his mother?
It's implied that Mirri Maz Duur infected his wound worse instead of trying to heal it, but yeah. Point still stands.
In the books she tried to heal him but he rubbed sand on his wound(and it's implied she knew he would do that) and it got fucked up further. It's quite confusing
That's the power of the theatre, bitch.
Drogo was killed by the witch though
>I find the Hound's survival less likely than Arya's but people don't go on and on about that.\n\nI agree, Hound should have died. \n\nA \"small knife?\" Look at this [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/h8U43CI.jpg). Looks pretty damn long to me and the Waif buries that thing to the hilt twice and twists it around after the last stab. And you can't be serious about the lower right abdomen not containing any vital organs. That blade was going right in the approximate area where you'd find the right ascending colon and packed coils of ileum and jejunum.
No vital organs as in the stab wound is not going to kill you like if you got stabbed in the heart.  Its the risk of infection, which is likely but its not guaranteed.  I would have preferred them be less dramatic about it yes, but it is not immersive breaking.
See, but I don't think that's satisfying. I get it, life is tough, not everything has a happy ending. But him going back is just not narratively fulfilling. It's like you said, him dying while killing Cersei is palatable, but it's certainly not a happy ending.\n\nUsing your analogy, if I were to watch a story about a drug addict, where he spent the entire film getting rid of it, only to give in in the last 10 minutes and die of overdose... I'd leave completely unsatisfied. I guess that's the point, but it feels cruel just to send a message of \"sometimes things are cruel\".\n\nHe spends 8 seasons struggling with that. At the season 6 finale, he looks both pissed and disappointed at Cersei when he watches her sitting on the throne. Only for him to go back. Feels like an utter waste
Indeed. Which is why I said \"on the context of the show\". The books can have a lot of internal development and monologue. All D&D had to do was not feel obliged to keep the book's ending, and realize that the show is its own thing.\n\nWell, first they actually had to give a fuck to what they were writing.
Tbh D&D probably don't have the chops to make up their own ending to such a complex story to begin with (maybe if it's a generic fantasy story, but it isn't), so they continued to rely on Martin's plot points because at that point there's too much of Martin's touch for them to just abandon and make up their own plot points along the way. Don't think they could coherently bring converging storylines together without his bullet points, even Martin himself is struggling with this that's why his books aren't close to finished.
Interesting cause I totally disagree! I thought the execution was pretyy horrid too, but the bullet points make sense to me.\n\nBran ending up king reminds me of King Leto II in Dune, a ruler who knows the best possible outcomes for humanity. I dunno I just find it more interesting then Dany or Jon ending up on the throne. BUT, they did not do any work to make the ending work whatsoever.
Why even have a throne though? Isn't it clear that one person holding all seven kingdoms is fucked up?\n\n  \n\n\nHow about making all seven kingdoms independent again? I thought they were gonna do something like that when Drogon burned the throne, you know, symbolism and shit, but no... I guess he just wanted to burn it.
Thinking Arya has the most intriguing story and her winning the \u201cfavorite Stark\u201d vote is exactly why we ended up with her supermanning the Night King. It\u2019s fun to point fingers but I will always unequivocally hold you clowns responsible for liking her way too much and leading to the Long Night
Yeah I agree that it\u2019s completely silly to be intrigued by the person who can perfectly imitate anyone and is trained by some kind of crazy assassin school. Yeah, that\u2019s not even close to as intriguing as some of the regular people in GoT. You\u2019re right.
When I next rewatch the show I'm genuinely just going to imagine those storyline getting different endings and still enjoy the build-up.\n\n...at least, that's my hope, maybe I will fail :(
I'll just never re-watch it. There are too many deserving writers out there to waste time being reminded of this trash ending. Thank God D&D are going to Star Wars - a series that's already sucking cock in an alley for every dollar its worth.
The white walker threat was barely a threat lmao, like no one died, they didn't need cersei, they didn't need anything, the only reason the wall even falls is because of Jon's stupid northern expedition.\n\nTry again.
6 named characters died, including two who have been in the show from season 1. They didn't get Cersei, but Jon is responsible for getting Dany to the fight, unifying the north, and getting just about every member of the cast minus Cersei, Qyburn, and Euron there, ultimately. And yes, the wall falls because of him, another way his arc is significant, just as Ned's is significant even though he dies and screws his entire family.\n\nI'm not saying the white walker plotline this season is a masterpiece. But to say Jon's arc doesn't matter because he doesn't stab the night king is absurd.
\"What the hell is wrong with Critics?!  THAT WAS AN AWESOME MOVIE!\" Angry Joe Suicide Squad review.\n\nYeah, no, I wince every time Angry Joe steps outside his comfort zone of videogames,  his TV show and movie reviews lack nuance to say the very least.
Yea, it seems like choosing the lesser of two evils lol. But yea, the North also seems like a dreadful place to live, maybe that influenced a lot of choices as well.
That is what it ends up being, sadly lol That probably did, the south seemed beautiful. However I live in a place like the north irl anyway so it would not be much of a change lol
His men where in a very defensible castle
With no hope of relief against a much larger force.
With a few more episodes her turn would have been believable. The worst thing imo was choosing Bran while not even mentioning the only two legitimate claims.
Or even Gendry now that he was made legitimate.
That was the second worst thing for me. The only set up for that that I can think of is that in Winterfell Tyrion asked him about his story. That is literally it. Add to that he said he doesn't want anymore. However when it comes to being king it is a ln entirely different story. \n\nOn the Aegon side of things, I can see him not being king and I would be okay with it. The injustice comes that not even one person mentioned him. WTF. How can you not at least mention him?!
The rightful heir was Gendry Baratheon, legitimized son of the King of the 7 Kingdoms of Westeros, when they were last unified.\n\nBy any 'modern' Westerosi view, his claim is better than anyone's.\n\n(Edit for clarity)
They didn\u2019t even mention the idea of Jon being king. All the talks Varys and Tyrion have about how Jon would make a great king? For nothing. All of the letters Varys sent to the other lords revealing Jon\u2019s true heritage? Never brought up again.\n\nI mean we all know Jon \u201cdint wahnt it,\u201d and I\u2019m not even saying he should\u2019ve been king, but it should\u2019ve at least been discussed.
I think that was ultimately the biggest problem here. It felt really rushed. I think that they could have even made this ending work if they put more effort and thought into it. Just not a quick gathering out of nowhere that instantly decides who becomes king.
Not to mention that her ending speech to her soldiers was one of the most over-the-top evil speeches I\u2019ve seen in years. It felt like it was 1 step away from being a speech Hitler would\u2019ve given. So much for subtlety.
It might have actually been more subtle if she did the nazi salute at the end. \\s\n\nIn addition to the speach, I know the unsullied have always been a little robotic, but the whole scene had an autocratic feel to it.
Really? She's been really vindictive and brutal from day one....
There is a large difference between being harsh toward your enemies and setting hunting down innocent people as you burn the entire city.\n\nAlso note, there was a time her dragons torched a kid and she locked them away because of it.
I feel the same way. I am hoping that going back to season 7 and then reading some fanfiction that I might be able to make it alright in my head.\n\nI also hope GRRM finally releases the rest of it. Although I don't know how much more tragedy for Daenerys I can take lol
I wouldn't go that far. Season 1-4 were amazing. 5 was pretty good too, 6 was a mix and 7 was pretty bad in hindsight. Season 8 was like someone poured gasoline on a dumpster fire and then launched it into the friggen sun.
I wonder how much longer you'll continue to whine about it on the internet then? A few more weeks?
because it objectively is shit?
Objectively is the new literally I see
Didn't know about the Sansawinsfanclub but the DanandDavefanclub can not exist with a negative opinion on the show and asoiafcirclejerk is a joke subreddit as are all circlejerk subs.  These subs are hardly a fair bar by which to measure anything.  This sub has been the champion of the show when compared to the other two significant asoiaf subreddits on this site and most other asoiaf non reddit forums.  It isn't that the sub is negative, it is that the show tanked.
Dan and Dave fan club? I just threw up in my mouth.
Which honestly says a lot more about you than them. Really, stop shitting on other people who just want to enjoy something.
I don't want to watch star wars where a plot point is one character forgets that another can use the force. Im in 2 minds to not see it, but i really love star wars.
Disney should of realised that GRRMs books were carrying those two. D&D were only good when they adapted existing material from the book, not when they actually had to write (even then they had a blueprimt).\n\nIf anything Disney should of hited GRRM to write a trilogy, my god I would love to see that \ud83d\ude02
I was already kind of done with Star Wars, the Disney movies were disappointments for me and TLJ was the last nail in the coffin.\n\nNow it's like they're going to pry open the coffin, take a dump in it, and seal it back up again.
I'm just waiting for those two to also abandon starwars as they are offered another job somewhere else like they appear to have done with GoT
You guys sound like crazy people do you actually stop to read what you write? WTF am I reading here.
This exactly. Dany's forces were ridiculously overpowered at the end of Season 6. So the writers threw in a bunch of absurd *anti*-deus ex machinas like:\n\n1. Euron's ability to completely surprise and devastate her fleet even though she had Yara who is also a top notch Iron Born seafarer\n\n2. Taking Casterly Rock in a brilliant surprise assault only for Highgarden to fall like it was made of wet newspaper \n\n3. ~~Losing essentially all of her forces at the Battle of Winterfell~~, no that's not it, ~~only half were gone~~, no that's not it either, actually everyone respawned for the attack on KL\n\n4. Losing 2 of her 3 dragons, including Rhaegal to three \"360 No Scope\", \"1 in a million\" shots in 10 seconds after she \"kind of forgot\" about the Iron Fleet even though they talked about it in the same episode minutes before\n\nIt was all ~~a bait and switch~~ *subverting expectations* to make it seem like it was going to be a struggle, all for Dany and Drogon to dunk on Cersei and her armies like Lebron playing some kindergarteners anyway.
I blame the decision to cut Aegon.
Even the deus ex machina fail because if she can cause that mu h destruction with 1 dragons, why bother killing the second especially when in the next episode you bump up the power level by 9000
No one in their right mind would march their entire army to Highgarden and leave KL undefended. When you know someone is trying to attack. \n\nThe whole plot of attaching Harrenhal was dumb as fuck as well.
Yup. And in 7.01 she still had 3 dragons and there were no scorpions.  She could have burned the Red Keep without touching anything else and she would have won.
Literally barely even needs her dragons in 7.01. All that needs to happen is this:  \n\nTyrion - \u201cSo I destroyed the vast majority of Stannis Baratheon\u2019s fleet with wildfire and he still *nearly* took the city. You have way way more forces than Stannis did, so you will go to KL and have the Unsullied and Dothraki break through the Mud Gate and kill the Lannister army. The Unsullied do as you command and the Dothraki think you\u2019re a God so they won\u2019t rape and pillage if you tell them so\u201d. \n\nVarys - \u201cAlso, I know all the Red Keep passage ways. Why don\u2019t you send me with Grey Worm and a few of your other top Unsullied killers and i\u2019ll show them the passages to Cersei\u2019s room.  \n\nDany - \u201cGreat thinking boys. It\u2019s a plan!\u201d  \n\nYara - \u201cWell my Uncle  Euron has a huge fleet, what if they try to attack us?\u201d  \n\nDany - \u201cLol I have dragons\u201d.  \n\nYara - \u201cFair point\u201d.
I mentioned this same thing during 8.05, why the fuck didn\u2019t she just sack Kings Landing BEFORE the battle with the dead? If 1 dragon took it that easily then 3 dragons wouldn\u2019t have even needed a single ground troop to help. AND Cersei didn\u2019t have any scorpions then.
Because she listened to Tyrion's dumbass advice that's why.
in season 7 dany didn't want to burn the city and she thought cersei was gonna help against the dead until 8.02. there's a lot of things in the last four seasons that i thought didn't make sense but i don't think this one is anywhere near the worst offender.\n\nedit: as i've so far gotten three responses to this comment i thought i'd clarify. i agree that it doesn't make sense which is why i didn't say it did but i do think that it still fits with dany's goal of avoiding killing innocents in 7.01. we've seen in the previous seasons and the books that the red keep doesn't house just lannisters so it's not too unfair to assume that there are people who are relatively innocent living there. indimitation might work but she'd still have to demonstrate the power of the dragons to the lannister soldiers somehow. i agree that she could've and should've seiged the city at the start of season 7. i did forget that dany doesn't learn about the army of the dead until later on in the season and i don't think she believed it until 7.06.
At that point, they dont know yet the nightking is a pushover vilain so they think they need Cersei army against him
This. Episode 3 had lots of fanboys defending it but it was a trainwreck and killed 7+ seasons of build up and ruined multiple story arcs. It wasn't even one of the best battle episodes
Was the worst battle episode they had and the worst episode in terms of thematic butchering
I was in denial that it was bad...looking back arya killing NK was fucking lame.
Lol at least the NK got a dragon out of that and raised huge amounts of hype for season 8 (lol)\n\nIn this season every time someone did something incredibly stupid it had 0 payoff.
Yep.  As stupid as the whole thing was I was super excited that the Night King got a dragon.  In fact....the dragon battle between the Night King, Jon and Dany in E3 might be my favorite part of season 8.
