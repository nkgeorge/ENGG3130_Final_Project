Once Newcastle scored they became a team that was above us in the league. And that sealed their fate.
Always stay humble and park the bus against us. We couldn't score after they swallowed their pride and sat back after the 4th goal. /s
Ahhh yes, someone else made a similar joke to me, I must have stolen it, it can't be that it isn't that creative to begin with and I'm sure you won't see it in this thread multiple times.\n\nYou have the link to the first \"Lingard is a young prospect\" joke?
Fair enough. Thought you had stolen it from him since he said it about halfway through the game, but I stand corrected.
Merry Chrismalling to you all.\n\nDownvote to hell.
Yea totally agreed.. He is such a bright spark this season.. Happy he is playing for us coz i would legit be jealous if he was playing for some other team
We do this over and over ,we get within touching distance of Chelsea then show our true colours and lose to relegation fodder, if any team will capitalise on Chelsea slipping up it's spurs
The opposite, we lose to lowly teams and drop down the table but when the big games come we show our true colours and climb to within touching distance of the top 4.
The season is long and spurs even under Mourinho haven't been great when they have every reason to be. Theres valid reasons why we havent been good at time and some unexplainable results as well but i think the top 4 battle won't be real until February. Stay in and around until then and hope a fit pogba can fire us to top 4.
We just beat Tottenham, they lost abysmally vs Chelshit, and we finally have Pogba back.
Pretty massive if given the inconsistency of this team
This inconsistency is expected. We have counted on Mctominay to hold our midfield together when prior to this season he wasn't even close to being a consistent starter. martial first season back at the 9 and rashford coming into his own this season like we never saw before. The only player coming into this season we could expect any level  of consistency with is pogba and he's been out. I think giving young players 4-6 months in a season to find consistency is fair given the unstable spot Mourinho left us in squad wise.

You would have thought last season would have given them both a bit of confidence with them being two of our most consistent players, especially with Wan-Bissaka and Maguire coming in as well but they've not really kicked on like we hoped. I wouldn't say they've been poor but they can both do a lot better.
3 points on Saturday is better than another 3 goals today.
Not really and I think Ole doesnt care about hat tricks since thats what SAF did with him as well
I think Norwich must be the 2nd one?
Brighton?
Mhmm.
I think the whole world knows this stat by now.
I don't really think we did much to draw them out. They sat back and basically didn't pressure us for the majority of the game IMO\n\nI'm glad for the result, but I don't think this was any kind of turning point for us personally
All that was different was Newcastle standing off our players in their low block. They applied 0 pressure and made no attempts to tackle or get tight. \n\nWe aren't getting better at beating the bus. We need better players to do that.
The kids exhausted because he is only 18
The difference is that Chelsea are gonna dump him and other youngsters eventually. They will splurge like crazy. That\u2019s all that they know.
Perhaps,  but so far,  regardless of recent results, it would seem Lampard is a capable coach.
We don't know this. Under Lampard they might take a different approach.
I fear for the day that they both have injuries at the same time
We'll have Greenwood Haaland partnership instead
Shhhhhh. We don\u2019t say that out loud here.
Yeah it was of course\n\nBut dammit I want my hat trick
That strike off the post.. Hnnnnnng

I just need the scousers to lose once, imagine the scenes when they win the league going unbeaten
Hope we cunt their record. Fuckers need to be reminded no matter what they achieve, United will always be there to take them down
Could've been top 1 if we won every single match :(
r/technicallythetruth
And still only 2 points ahead of Liverpool lol, absolutely outrageous when you think about it
Your aunt could have been your uncle if she had a penis.
I like it better as \u201cand if my aunt had nuts she\u2019d be my uncle\u201d but still good
Who says she doesn't?
Lol. He literally was stood in the middle of the field like a director, pointing out where everyone else had to pass it to. \n\nThey mostly followed too.
Like he was conducting his own little orchestra there
When Pogba is back the squad runs through him, make no mistake about it.
He kept pointing at passing options when other players had the ball
He always has for me ever since Ibra left. Seeing them two play together was glorious, seriously the only two we had on that wave length at the time.
Have been trying to say this, particularly about players like Fred. Fred's \"good games\" have meant he's controlled midfield and moved the ball around.\n\nThat's not enough for a top side - that's the bare minimum. Players need to contribute by playing forward passes, making space, getting assists, and occasionally chipping in with a goal.
We had already taken the lead at that point so his shot didn\u2019t do as much for years team as you are suggesting but it was a good shot nonetheless.
Maybe so but when he takes a shot from distance its almost always off target
Its almost like their form was unsustainable. Don't they call it a 'new manager bounce' around here?
Well, except Leicester and Sheffield.
I'm hoping that other teams emulate Sheffield's playstyle. Would like to see overlapping CBs catch on.
Please kindly point out where I've said that?\n\nUnited is losing atm let's have an upvote party calling for ole's head is what I'm calling out. :)
I agree, seems kinda ridiculous to do that mid game regardless of the outcome, but either way it's not ridiculous to still be Ole out at all.
Good riddance. If you stop watching after 17 minutes and 1 goal, you're not a real fan.
Why can\u2019t people want ole out, guys clueless as a manager. The first 20minutes were fucking woeful and they are justified in what they said. Rest of the game was good much improved but ole still needs to go.
Clueless as a manager but has beaten Pep and Mourinho? Obviously he has a lot of things to improve on but get some perspective mate.
I'm calling out the people that straight up said they were switching off after just 15 minutes. They can get fucked. If you still want Ole out, while I don't agree, that's a justifiable opinion after this season, but not watching just because we go down is what I'm annoyed at.
These guys have a memory span of an actual fish, I swear\n\nNo matter how dreadful we are, one win and they're dancing with smiles on their faces ready to give Ole a lifetime contract\n\nUpd: now we will get downvoted, but that's because we just won. Two weeks later, after a couple of horrific performances, these same words would be upvoted to hell
Still think we should get Poch. Been here since PSG. Ain't going nowhere because one result this or that way.
The same Poch who just got sacked for not cutting it at Spurs, or a different one?
Yeah, people who don't change their opinion that easily are hear. It's just that we get downvoted to oblivion by the topred positivity brigade.
Go into hiding or be mass downvoted for having an opinion against the grain?
Nothing wrong with having that opinion but essentially trying to celebrate our manager being sacked is a bit weird.
Having an opinion is fine but some of the things people say are just embarrassing tbh
You got it
Why? It's one game. One game shouldn't be enough to sway you if you were Ole out before this game.
It's more then one game now already ain't it?spurs, city.\n\nIt seems to the negative cunts resetting the wins everytime is the norm
Having someone attack a cross like that is something we\u2019ve been crying out for since Lukaku left
Even then he still often picked the wrong pass and shot too often.
Yes, Shearer mentioned that a few time in commentary and was spot on.
Especially when it's against such poor opposition.
He wasn\u2019t shit. His decision making though is dreadful. That pass to martial when greenwood was in fucking acres of space made my blood pressure reach dangerous levels.
That was annoying, plays with his head down so he misses so many good options
Exactly. Newcastle were garbage but his decision making in tougher games will bone us.
He was shit relative to a good 10. It is crucial to pick the right passes in situations he's been at. For his standard and Lingard's he was decent. Just shows how we have absolutely no depth or class in that position.
Trying to get him a hat trick
He had some good moments.  That #10 position is the best place for him clearly but he's still quite a ways from what we need there.
He was.
He wasn't great, but not shit.
I watched the game, he was shit
Yes, whatever your view on Ole is I do give him credit for how he has managed Greenwood. The challenge with any young player who bursts on the scene is keeping their feet firmly on the ground and I do think Ole is able to do that with Greenwood in a way that wasn't done with Januzaj when he had his moment.
Ngl I do agree, but I don't want to keep on ragging on the guy as I end up sounding like a broken record when I do these write ups and also Ole's the one who picks him in the squad.
Ok fair enough. He so goddam frustrating to watch. I just don\u2019t get how someone can be so consistently awful. \n\nHe is not that bad a player, someone needs to teach him how to shield a ball.
Rashnaldo indeed
I don't know about other people, but I spend way more time watching this god damn club than I should.
I do too, I'm late to work today because I stayed up watching the match
Yeah. Like sure this was a good game, but the whole season is still abysmal. There is good tactical changes that made this game good. Somehow it's wrong to apreciate that if you've been criticising Ole this whole season.
Yeah. I don\u2019t get why people who want Ole just act like as if we\u2019re going to be on a long run of wins just be because we get the occasional victory. We\u2019re won consecutive league games only once all season and we haven\u2019t kept a clean sheet in 3 months
Do you criticise the players when we lose then?
Nope. If we lose, it's all on the coaching staff
I think James should be played in his preferred position in the left. All his 3 goals have come from that position.
Pogba just brings another dimension to our play honestly. I can't really pin point what it is specifically, but we look so much more threatening when he's on.
He draws defenders towards him simply because the threat he poses and that opens up spaces for the others.
Pass him the ball and he shields it so well, it\u2019s literally impossible to take it off him
Because he's a world class player.
And younger brother Matty has scored twice against us.  I do know that means shit.  Just felt like saying it.
That's what McSauce is for
Can\u2019t disagree with this. We\u2019ll desperately need to bring in someone else in January though.
Depends on the team. Against teams that sit back we don't need that extra midfielder.
That\u2019s true, however it can be very risky considering how the season has gone so far and Pogba\u2019s positioning in the last 20 minutes. He likes to drift forward, and today had a few instances where he left only Fred behind when Newcastle won the ball back.\n\nLuckily Newcastle gave up, but in a tight match that could be a huge weakness.
I'm sorry, I am, but he did the same he's done for months, same formation, same tactics, same players. Starting Greenwood was a must as James has looked tired as hell recently. Lingard for Pereira was a change he's made a bunch, almost a rotation at this point. \n\n\nNewcastle were dreadful! Goalkeeper error first goal (nice shot by Martial, great layoff pass by Pereira), Defensive catastrophe for Greenwood goal (great strike Greenwood), Weak in the air for Rashford goal (great header Rashford, soooo good to see)...\n\n\nI'm sorry there's no Ole masterclass here. Our players performed as they should, they reacted really well to going behind, and got the job done against a dreadful Newcastle performance. \n\n\nI am not Ole Out but do believe he badly needs to improve tactically, and I really want him to, would love him to be a wild long term success (love the guy).
And it changed in 2-3 years ffs
That's what a WC manager with strong support from the board gets you.
TAA is as good as KDB with his range of passing and crossing.
I hate how good he is
ahh so that's the secret.../r/redeevils needs to make sure you attend all the games!!
Could be Matic behind Pogba and Fred in a 4-3-3 if we need to sit deep, though Lingard does well as a pressing CAM in those games.
I'm in exactly the same boat as you and it stings so much. People use my backing of him to attack Ole and other opinions I've held on footballing matters. I'm sure people will use it to attack my judgement of non footballing matters too, soon.\n\nIt's nonsensical and pathetic from me as I've never met the man but I'm not angry, just really disappointed. He's let me down big time \ud83d\ude02
We were several goals up an just subbed off our two best attackers. Of course we were less dangerous lmfao. That\u2019s not lingards fault.
We had a spell where we passed the ball around for 10mins. I think JLingz was the only player not to touch the ball .
Our great DoF man Ed Woodward has seen no need to appoint another DoF, which means he has everything under control.\n\nDo not worry, fellow citizen!
We just gotta work together!
He also played a big part in the build up for Martial\u2019s first goal
If they can be consistent, then maybe Ole can concentrate on fixing the other areas.
that\u2019s true \n\ni\u2019d like a lot of investment in the midfield\n\nimo we need 2-3 more midfielders and we sell pereira and matic \n\nthat way we can rotate McTom, Pogs, Fred and the new signings
if you go with purely matches we won its 100%
Fair enough.  But I\u2019d say the PL is probably the most relevant statistic.  As I would imagine most fans would rather us win the Premier League than anything else.  That\u2019s how I feel anyway.  Cup wins are good,  don\u2019t get me wrong.  But I think the real measure of a team is the PL.
This is a stat I can get behind
That went in like a rocket even after the deflection
We\u2019re about 2 or 3 years away from a title challenge.\n\nMan Utds avg age of the starting squad this season is 24 years and 321 days. \n\nWhile both Liverpool and Mancity have avg age of 27 years and around 50 days for their starting eleven. \n\n The avg age of prem squad is 27 years and 275 days this season. \n\nSo if the law of averages hold, and the oft repeated saying is true, \u201cyou don\u2019t win anything with kids\u201d, then we\u2019re at least 2 years away from assembling a squad that can challenge for the title. \n\nWould also love to get stats on the age of squads that have won the league title over the past 10 or 20 years, which might blow an Ole shaped hole in my quick and dirty thesis.
I would love for us the challenge, but I don\u2019t think 2 players and 3 years does it. This Liverpool side haven\u2019t lost a prem game in 62 matches now. That\u2019s crazy. They are champions of Europe, club World Cup champions, and almost certainly have the league secured too. \n\nI hate it, but united are no where near that Liverpool team, for a number of reasons. As said before, we need a better manager, a DF, I would say 3-4 starters and then other squad players, and a good 4-5 years of solid positive football.
In the time until we acquire those key players, our current crop will have improved too. Dont forget how young our team is!\n\n\nHowever, i doubt itd be a successful leauge challenge. We need at least a couple years to get all the players to gel etc
You didn\u2019t get the hype because you don\u2019t seem to actually know a whole lot, one of those armchair managers as evidenced by your statement about us needing new players in all those positions.
That's a bit harsh, I think.\n\nWe've all got our options, right or wrong.\n\nI disagree with him, but I think many fans would agree that a right winger and two midfielders (to replace fellaini, Herrera and maybe soon Matic) would be good additions to our squad (as would I in those positions). \n\nThe striker role is debatable, but us needing something \u201cdifferent\" up front is something I've heard from fans and pundits alike, so you can't really slate him for that too much.\n\nThat would be 4 players, not far off from your 2-3.\n\nAnother CB is bullshit for me, but that's my opinion and I'm no more of an expert than he is.\n\nAs for the left back position I have to say I really rate Shaw, but he is injury prone. I'd like to say we can mount a challenge with him as starter and Young/Williams as his backup, if we fix the those other positions. But I don't think anyone is necessarily stupid for thinking we can't. Look at City who lost Laporte; suddenly they're not in the race anymore. I wouldn't blame a fan for thinking we could suffer the same way if we lose Shaw (which might happen, as he is prone to injury).\n\nTL;DR:\nMy point is that most of the positions he stated he wants us to have new players in are reasonable or at least justifiable, even if we don't agree with the guy you're responding to.\n\nI don't think it does our community any good to discredit others as \u201carmchair managers\" just because they have a different opinion.
Ur right. I think I'll  just go back to my hole.
Wish it was one though
Yeah! We need 3 quality additions to the team...with a midfielder being the priority! A few better players behind that front three and we would look very very dangerous!! Our current front 4 options can rotate really well...imagine if instead of lingard ole put on James for rashford down that left side!! I'm sure we would have seen another goal!! \n\nJust need to add a bit nore quality to the team!!
Love your optimism mate.  \nLet's start by winning next game and push for a top 4 position so we can attract the quality players you hope for.
What is scary is to think that it mostly depends on Ed
Perreira made the wrong pass at least twice when he could've easily set a teammate through to a great chance.
Pereira wasn't amazing; did alright but his decision making was still a bit shit.\n\nDe Gea didn't do anything wrong really but didn't have a lot to do either.\n\nShaw deserves credit but wasn't *amazing* either. A solid performance from him though.\n\nBasically everyone else played really well I thought; even those three were solid.
This and city away is the only hope
Nuno wilder jose ole masterclass incoming, hopefully.
Spurs are crap against top teams
Gave me a headache,Jesus.
Criscus Ronford
This is a stat I can get behind
and they are likely going to win it again next season as none of the challengers seem ready. Pep might leave city
Leicester just aren\u2019t at their level lol
Too true. But they really didn\u2019t look even top four material in that game. At home, with everything to play for, they just flopped entirely. Maddison, Youri, Evans, Chilwell, all these players that fans have a habit to purr over, looked atrocious. Only ones who came out looking good for me were Ndidi and the Turkish lad, and even he gave away a penalty.
24
I refuse to believe you watched the match.
Yep all 90 mins, what else you wanna know?
Best shot of the game.
Andreas shouldn't even be the second option, let alone a starter for us. He had his chances but he's just not good enough. He always seem to make the wrong choice in any situation.
He\u2019s making slow but steady improvement. He\u2019s a decent option in the squad, especially for the next couple of seasons with how many positions they need to sign for. That\u2019s not to say he\u2019s not one of the most obvious areas we can improve, but even after we sign, hopefully, a centre mid, an attacking mid, and a right forward, he can still be useful as relief.
Andreas was absolute pure garbage today. The only time he did a couple of good things is when we were 4-1 up.\n\nBefore that he constantly lost the ball, made the wrong decisions, useless fucking player.
He assisted Martial for his first goal. 'The only time he did a couple of good things is when we were 4-1 up'\n\nAgenda poster
Tonali looks quality but Italian players never seem to work out well for us :/
Their policy means they've got no choice
Not surprising when you think about it. Lingard is good at pressing but does not do well in tight spaces. Big teams generally leave more spaces between the lines so it's easier to press the more isolated centerbacks into mistakes. Passing is easy with so much space to work with particularly on the counter.\n\nBoth players have their niche, but yes Lingard shouldn't start in general. He should used like Park, for his energy in big games.
Football fans in general seem to have pretty poor impulse control.
As soon as we improve at beating the lower half teams instead of lowering ourselves to their level (or lower, lol) things will be looking so much brighter. We have seen that Ole's United can match or beat the best on a good day.
Beating the small teams should be standard, but we can't do it. Ole can't seem to dmset the team up right and we usually need to be sparked into life. The big teams play to suit us, leaving gaps in behind
I agree about waht you say about Rashford but today Martial played really well and at the end, that's what matters haha.\n\nAnd yes, AWB si very very predictible, but at least he has tried to go forward. He is not good tecnically but he is very fast and string so what he has done today, he can do it more times and the cross has been really good tbh.\n\nAnd shaw,, don't know man, everytime I look at him, he is walking and not running and out of position. Thinking about he is our first choice by far and the fact that he is in something like 200k a week... I can't with him haha
I\u2019ll give you the first 2 points but I think you should have a closer look at Shaw... he\u2019s not walking half as much as you think he is... he got forward so much today. Think \u00a3200k is about the going rate for a Man U player these days unfortunately
You asked whether you are just a hater - the answer is yes. You hate Shaw, and you are selectively noticing anything he does badly - look at his stats from tonight and you'll realise he had a pretty decent game. He covered a lot of ground so how you are getting that he didn't run I have no idea, he set up a goal by running with the ball past 2 players... stop hating on the guy, he's our best left back by a mile
> for me he didn\u2019t do anything that Rashford doesn\u2019t do every single game\n> \n> \n\nHe finished a 1-v-1, which I absolutely would have no confidence in Rashford doing.  It's small, yes.  And expected of a striker.  But, I feel like Rashford loses his head in those kinds of situations, whereas Martial has a calm state-of-mind.
I meant the work rate aspect of his game, Martial has been getting loads of attention tonight for doing something that Every other player does every game
Agreed, and I think that's a problem Mourinho had too: it's not clear how he wants to play, so it's not easy to know which players to recruit. The top teams have a way they want to play and recruit according to those needs.\nWe instead change our way of playing from week to week (Mourinho because he wanted to adapt to each opponent, Ole because it seems he hasn't settled on our best team or system yet).
Yeah, that's why it's so important to have a DOF. Him and the manager decide how they want to play and sign from that.\n\nBut this is one of the things why I don't think Ole is the right man. If you have pogba, you have to play with a 433, it's something that all the people know and don't know why since the start of the season he decided to play with a 4231, without singing any top CAM.\n\nIMO we should play with a 433 and sign someone to replace what Herrera was but it seems that we still don't know even what is our best formation haha
[removed]
This. Mistakes happen when you\u2019re faced with good play.
Agreed, I've enjoyed watching high intensity pressing from our side but sadly it didn't result in many touches inside the penalty box and that's a problem(due to lack of creativity /flair)
How is it sad that our pressing forced a lot of mistakes out of Newcastle?
There are system issues and personnel issues. If you take good players out of Liverpool or City, they\u2019ll just play the same way but won\u2019t be able to execute the plans. We have a system issue and a personnel issue. Good players won\u2019t make us win games consistently if our movement is bad, our passing sloppy, our pressing haphazard, and our defending shambolic
You look at other teams obvious flaws and they actually seem to be trying to do something about them instead of just repeating the same pattern over and over.
Yeah. I am 100 % Ole out, but I want to see Ole in another position. Maybe some kind of PR for the team or something. However, I am not sure if Poch wants to come. However, I believe that this club has more structure than Arsenal etc.\nWe will have to wait and see how the next transfer windows develop
Pogbas not a 10. I'm not sure why this is so difficult for some of you. We need to buy a proper 10 as soon as the window opens.
They base their opinions on Fifa.
Idk why but this comment made me piss myself \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02
But garner is inferior in terms of physicality. Timbo is quite aggressive and more built for the prem.
Fosu Mensah
Oh damm. Totally forgot about him, figured he was sent out on loan or something
Noway Greenwood should start. I think we'll play Fred Lingz and Pogba, with Rash and Martial and James
Probably. But James would be more useful against Arsenal, not impossible that Mason starts and Danny comes on after 55-60 minutes.
No he wasnt. You're being disingenuous.
Nah that\u2019s you. Every time McTominay has a good game you come out and say he\u2019s crap and say he\u2019s not enough but he keeps proving you wrong and how essential he is in our team.
2 halfs btw. Scott was injured pretty much the whole first half. Fred carried him
I doubt McSauce plays next match.
Nah, fred is a better midfielder than mctominay. Passion and desire can only get you so far.
Fred is wayy better than mctominay
He really is but you're downvoted because McTominay has 'heart' and 'passion'. Never mind his lack of ability on the ball
Wasn't great in the second? Everything went through him! He's streets above Mctominay the passion merchant
Lol, scott was injured the whole first half and fred had to carry him through it.
He got dispossessed leading to their first goal. So its not like he had a solid game.
I'd play Greenwood ahead of James
So would I,  had he not played 90 minutes and James rested.
I think James against the teams that will attack us and Greenwood against the rest is what Ole should do but seeing as he got 90 tonight I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll start against Burnley-probably isn\u2019t physically up to that much football in such a short space of time yet.
He was also hobbling a bit, safer to keep him for burnley
Seriously. I love ole, but results speak for themselves. I\u2019m not ole in or ole out, but I have no problem with fans being frustrated with him and wanting him out. Didn\u2019t he go like 10 games without a win ?
Huh?
[deleted]
I presume he was saying you can't call people plastic because you're American.
Who said that ?
[deleted]
I'm talking more about minutes than position.
Daniel James?
He was signed as an impact sub, even he's said he's played a lot more than he expected to
He can't play every game.
Pogboom then. Some long range shots from him should bring their defence forward.
Score first and we win.
If we can go hard from the whistle, and keep the intensity up if we don\u2019t score right away, I think we should win comfortably.  \nBurnley are tired as well, and we took key players off the pitch early last night. Our squad is also younger and should be fitter than theirs. Let\u2019s hope the supposed \u00abold school and out dated\u00bb running in pre-season will pay off tomorrow.
I think we won every game at Burnley and so did most of the top 6 teams, am I wrong?
\"Watford\"
Sorry you're right.\n\nI'm a moron lol
\n>I'm a ~~moron~~ optimist lol\nFTFY
I can see Arteta getting a win. Chelsea have flaws that are out there for all to see, and Arsenal have the tools to exploit them.
for THEIR first goal he was pivotal, I can tell you that much
Did you go blind for our goal?
Think we need to snap up chill we\u2019ll from Leicester
He was pretty rubbish against Liverpool, as was our would-be second-coming-of-Beckham, James Maddison.
Brandon Williams
Think we need to snap up chill we\u2019ll from Leicester
Newcastle deserved to be up 2-0 in those 15mins.
Wasn't Maguire brought in to deputize our defence?\n\nI'm not in the 'he's a poor signing' camp that I've seen bandied about here, but still.  I thought he'd solve us conceding these silly goals.
Who knows? I mean I haven't heard anything specific about the expected features of his performance. But from a fan POV, I personally would have had that hope - he appeared pretty dominant with Leicester. Alas, there seems much confusion in our defence. \n\nMy thinking is that Schmeichel or perhaps their defensive coaching was bringing about a leadership or united confidence in their back line. Whatever is was, it's lacking here.
Oh okay. That's actually smart. Didn't think about it that way.
We were unusually clinical today, that is true.\n\nNewcastle looked the stronger team until Martial sneaked in his first goal at the near post. If the keeper makes a better save (he really could have, he stepped the wrong way at first after all) that game could\u2019ve easily swung the other way like it has all season.\n\nNewcastle made horrendous mistakes for a top flight team, whether we pressed well or not
And if my aunt had balls she'd be my uncle.
No need to be upset! I\u2019m happy we won. And we\u2019ve definitely been unlucky this season so it balances out a little.\n\nBut I\u2019m right to be concerned that we looked abysmal against Newcastle for 20 minutes. If Newcastle actually rode their momentum without pissing it away, you\u2019d be the one mad in the post match thread at the team and not at me!
first 20 was awful, i do agree. \n\nbut i would argue that 2/4 of the goals we scored were mistakes from Newcastle forced to happen due to our incessant pressing. (Mason + Martial\u2019s 2nd).\n\nadded to Rashford\u2019s header - i\u2019ll gladly take a 3-1 win.
Might just be me, at this stage, I wouldn't want to be too concerned on the \"bad parts\" whenever we win the game.
Lol\n\nMy point is the scoreline suggests we dominated when that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. This sub is going to be aggravated beyond belief the next time we drop points from the exact same situation.\n\nI\u2019m capable of enjoying the win and recognizing we need to address the fact that we started so poorly. 4-1 shouldn\u2019t hide that
Yeah, we did start poorly, but to suggest Newcastle gifted us the win is a bit much IMO. We were all over them once we equalized. They were absolutely terrible after that. \n\nImagine we heard 50m for Longstaff last summer, hahaha.
But we did dominate? I felt bad the second half for Newcastle
I only watched the highlights so I can't really comment much but I do agree with you to a certain extent. The goals were more from opponent errors rather than our build-up play. \n\nThis team needs to actually concentrate for the full 90 mins and try not to give up stupid goals or play well when going behind. With abit more concentration and luck we should be able to grind a few more results. \n\nAnyway not gonna complain, a win is a win which is much needed after 2 abysmal results.
A terrible Pereira in DM is a better passer than Mctominay
I uhh... Beg to differ.
For you maybe, read this thread. So many people trying to berate fans that just aren't as excited as they are over one result.
Oh haha\n\nPersonally I'm waiting for a 5 games streak, haven't got that since the honeymoon. And very rarely under Mou.\n\nAnd I believe my expectations have become risibly low.. But then again, saying \"It's only Newcastle\" is very negative
I totally agree and I don't come on here to stomp on the team for no reason, however it's infuriating to see everyone's flippy flopping from week to week. There is a problem and it wont just go away, so why can't people see things in measure and context.
Fair enough man, nothing wrong with that. We all just want to win.
I used to be like that all the way this season and last but watching them failing against the worst team in the league was the final straw
That's understandable mate.. Here's hoping the team turns it around and gets back to where we belong
They're not that smart
It's actually the entire year and a half of inconsistent football  ,Watford was the tipping point , the game I lost all faith in the man
He hasn't even been here a year and a half
I'd agree hes was missing out a lot and can't expect full potential from him. If you like it better, I rate second half Fred above second half Pogba.
I'd rather say he was mediocre, I rate Freds performance today above his. (ofc not counting the shootings from distance) Fred worked harder, while Pogba was trying to succeed with key passes and through balls, but without a result. Like the smally tricky pass to Lingard at the end, or the lob (if such an English word exists) to Mata - which was a great vision, but wrong execution sadly.
Not at all, I think the youngsters pace is the future of our team, but I feel we lack the routine because we fill up mostly with younger players. (or we have the \"old\" ones in defence)
I'm curios why do you think it is?
The thing is, we didn't settle with \"seeing the game through\", we still performed with a relatively high level of intensity and were hungry for more goals and I applaud the team for that, but we failed to deliver, our passing and running was not fluid. I'm not shitting on this win, just expressing my nervousness toward the next match.
I watch because I love this team and I want them and Ole to succeed. And for them to succeed, they must be able to break down the low block consistently. Today, we won not because of that, but because Newcastle came out to play and were punished for their mistakes. On another day, it could have been Watford all over again. My criticism is fair and reasonable, I'm not trying to be negative at all.
You're complaining we didn't score more while we were up 4-1, that seems negative.\n\nI get your larger point.  But it's hard to score against teams when they pack their box!  Also leads to more randomness in results.  It's just good strategy for less talented teams that will, unfortunately for us, pay off for them sometimes.\n\nSo why feel confident we can crack a team that sits back on us?  First, we're more talented, and while it will work to slow us down, we will win more often over a larger sample.\n\nTwo, Greenwood will be playing more, and he is our best chance of just beating defenders heads up.\n\nThree, Shaw will get better as he returns to form.  He was our PotY last year for being able to transition from defense to offense.   Add him into a mix with AWB and Williams, and get Dalot on and Young off, and we can crack those teams better.\n\nFour, McGuire seems more willing to initiate offense.  We've been taking it up the wings fairly exclusively the past year.\n\nBut the biggest thing is getting Pogba back.  Say what you want about his consistency, he is one of the best in the world at unleashing those outstanding long passes up the middle.  He's an upgrade over everything we have in the midfield and takes those minutes away from everyone who isn't Fred or McT.  But more importantly, his ability to make the long pass forward is what we need to crack those squads that try and sit back on us.  He showed that against Watford but it was too little too late.
I don't want decent I want word class. If we want to compete with the best only Pogba is starting material out of those 3.
Awesome
Because you can do it on fifa!!
In pereires role
Is he better than pereira right now ?
Because there is no reason to be talking about Liverpool owning the league in our match thread when there is a Daily Discussion post available
It's also true
It was STUPIDITY
It was STUPIDITY
pogba? consistent? roflmao
Learn to read. Key word expect.
[removed]
We had only 42% possession that game
Hahaha wow we were efficient
lol, at home too
I don't know how to feel about Lampard right now. Chelseas squad is still pretty damn good and yet he has still struggled in a few games.\n\nInconsistent I suppose, a bit like us. Maybe due to the young squad? (although Chelsea has far more experience and depth in their squad).
I think Lampard is still learning, but he has the makings of a good coach, similar to OGS.
It was \"ice in his veins\" I assumed.
Well he was pretty calm while providing the assists for our goals.
He gets a \u00a320 bag of heroin for each goal scored.
I thought it was more of an 'inject this into my veins' kind of thing. Wouldn't be surprised if he got into trouble for it from the mardy twats at the PL
Celebrate like a knobhead against us, get fucked. Pardew says hello.
Literally the truth
What the hell is an \"Ole out upvote party\" even going to accomplish anyways lol?\n\nNot like Ed's reading this sub and shitting his pants because some redditor got all mad, it's ridiculous.
100% correct. I truly don\u2019t think it\u2019s his fault that we can\u2019t break down teams that just sit back as especially when pogba isn\u2019t fit, we just don\u2019t have the personnel to be able to do that. \n\nThen people will say \u201cwell why didn\u2019t he sign an attacking midfielder\u201d but i\u2019m sure he wanted to, and that\u2019s on the Glazers. The signings he has made have definitely improved our lineup and hopefully he\u2019ll be allowed to make a few more over the next couple windows, really hope the board get behind him!
Uhuh funny thing the person hasn't actually said what you're talking about. We're just calling out the reactionary morons.
I know, I'm relating to his words on Ole, which are absolutely true. He's clueless as a manager, you really have to be deluded af with all those dogmatic \"but he's a red devil\" approaches to not see it.\n\nIf it wasn't for his past achievements, this sub would be exploding with people wishing his departure
Nope, that is wrong. If you watch when the team gets it. It fucking beautiful. When they don\u2019t grasp it is terrible. That is why it is a process. We are seeing youth come up and make an impact. The academy is where we should look not our check book. Let\u2019s spend another billion and not get anywhere.
I agree that celebrating his sacking is weird but I was just pointing out that it's not really that people \"go into hiding\" but more that anything they say is immediately shoved to the bottom of the page. My stance hasn't changed but I've learned you can't have a real discussion here because of how people react after results in either direction
If you\u2019re Ole out, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. He\u2019s had one transfer market (no, last January doesn\u2019t count). He\u2019s got us right in the thick of top 4 and didn\u2019t have his best player for 3 months. The man deserves fucking time. Going for Poch or whoever is the \u201chot name\u201d is at the moment has fucked us since SAF retired. If you can\u2019t see that, I feel sorry for you.\n\nThis season was always going to be a rebuild. The squad had to be gutted and rebuilt by Ole after Mou. United should\u2019ve been able to bring in more players over the summer, but it\u2019s clear the Glazers/Woodward are holding back the club from doing that. So here we are. Ole bringing stability and taking time to rebuild the proper way. With youth and intelligent transfers.
That's fair enough. I don't agree with downvoting people for an opinion they have, that's just pointless. \n\nA lot of the time it can be how they present their opinion, if it is one that goes against peoples.
We've played well against top teams, because we can counter. But suck against poor teams. There's tons of evidence to support that.
Seems like a good time Charlie, plays relatively better when we're winning
What do you mean?
Loool he was shit , literally could\u2019ve scored 2 more goals if he just picked the right pass
Maybe my standards have been lowered because of his other performances.
Hello fellow Asian
Why hello
Absolutely need someone to provide depth and challenge for Fred. The man will be running on fumes in February if he can keep up this level of play.
Good point. Can have one of Scott or Fred sit back when we're attacking. Hopefully we'll get to the point where we won't need three midfielders for winnable games.
I remember the hate on this sub a few years ago saying  Klopp was doing it wrong and he wouldn\u2019t last at pool. He was running the players to death and they would never amount to anything doing it his way...
LMAO that's hilarious.
And time to rebuild without the axe hanging over his head
Being a WC manager usually earns you that privilege.
Now you know why we had the ball for 10 mins. /s
Tbh I don't care, taking it 1 win at a time no matter the game. I would be absolutely ecstatic if we could win ANY trophy this year, it all adds up.
I don\u2019t disagree.  I think you\u2019re missing my point.  There was a time when Liverpool were winning cups and we\u2019d said,  it doesn\u2019t matter,  we are better in the league,  I\u2019m just stating facts, my friend.  I just want us winning, period.
I may have been a bit harsh, I was just arguing against his point.
How many years of English did you take because I read through your last comment thinking you were just making fun of English fans.
***The usual nosh from the usual noshers***. I feel attacked.
Yeah thats kinda what I want. He should be a squad player but I\u2019m not comfy with him starting.
Truthfully, for him to start, he needs to do a lot more. With all the players the club could grab, if he doesn't start delivering assists and goals regularly, he won't last. It's just a sad fact for players at a club like this, there are decent players all over Europe that could come in, he'll have to compete with them and if he doesn't step his game up markedly he won't be in the team.
You are right I forgot he completed a 2 meter layoff without massively fucking it up like everything else.
He has to be in that position and evade markers just to be there, so you\u2019re definitely being harsh there.
Yeah but it shouldn't be impossible to accomplish this. It would be worse if we only beat the lower half teams and looked completely out of our depth against the top 6.\n\nEdit: add a couple signings so that we don't have to play the likes of Lingard, Mata and Pereira and we should be creating a lot more chances against poor teams.
It's a mentality thing that comes from the top. Team look devoid of spark and imagination. It looks like they don't train together, like a bunch of strangers waiting on a mistake or a moment of brilliance. That's from the manager. Any other man with his CV would never have got the job, and so far it's showing
I mean, I don't blame him for making 200k a week, I wish I was him haha. But if you look at Newcastle's goal, he  is not in his position and he is not running back. It was the 20th minute and of course the goal it's not all his fault, but a big part of it in my opinion yes
Think you should watch it again, he\u2019s up high because we were attacking then. He bombs it back into position whilst Maguire and Lindelof are the ones scrabbling around.. he\u2019s not at fault for not being able to track Longstaff either that was Fred\u2019s man..
Hmmm... fair enough.\n\nBut I'd rather intelligent runs, than energy-wasting runs.\n\nHis style-of-play pisses me off sometimes (coming to the ball, rather than running), but that is who he is.  I guess I can't blame him if it gets him goals, even if it isn't the most appealing thing to watch (as a fan!)
I'm talking about the touches in the oppos pen box.
FIFA lists him as CM/CDM. Don't forget his form at Juve before he came back. And he was used more in attacking there.
He doesn't mean they go by what fifa lists him as, they mean that on fifa pogba is a great number 10, because you can move players around and all that matters is their base stats, so they are assuming that because Pogba has \"82 shooting\" and \"90 dribbling \" on fifa, he will obviously be good at number 10, or because he scored some goals that means he can play there - the reason you see so many experts on tactics and players and positions is because of football manager and fifa- Pogba's position is left of a midfield 3. We don't play 433 though, so his next best position is a part of the 2. We have tried him at 10 several times and our fanbase seems to forget that- he isn't a good 10, he needs to be on the ball more and deeper with space.
Considering Mason played 90 mins yesterday! And is 18 years old. That would be irresponsible imo but what do I know
Depends on his condition after last night, might be possible for him and James to play one half each. I think he is much more useful against a low block.
We didn't really play that hard in the 2nd half though. Also, being young means you can play more games without being tired.
keeps proving me wrong how? Fred has outperformed him in recent games. McTominay's passing is atrocious. He's rated by 'top reds' because he's an academy product who 'gets the club' and 'has heart and passion'. In reality he's a decent squad player but nowhere close to a player that should be starting for a team challenging for top honors. How has he proved me wrong?
Fred played better when McTominay\u2019s work rate is on the pitch. That\u2019s evident enough from the games played this season but you chose to ignore that. Also, SAF and Jose Mourinho publicly rated McTominay and so does Ole, not just your so called  \u2018top reds\u2019. I think you and I know who\u2019s opinion holds more weight.
Also, managers will hardly say bad things about their players. Fergie thought Jones could go down as one of uniteds greatest players. Jonny Evans too.
That\u2019s some low iq thinking, I lived in Manchester for a time lol
But there is a Burnley is a tough place to myth
Absolutely. I hope we can beat Burnley now.
By a country mile
Exactly
We absolutely destroyed them though, one of the best performances this season imo.
Yeah honestly could\u2019ve been 6
Wrong Longstaff, sorry.
That could be it too, I was just making a guess because I wasn't sure
How exactly is he clueless?
If you're asking such questions there's no point in even trying to explain, I've repeated these words so many times on this sub I'm actually tired of it.\n\nPeople saying they distance themselves from this sub when we're losing, I'm doing the opposite - after every win this place explodes with fake positivity and delusional takes
Bro stability is the one big thing we lack, its been a year, behind on points compared to mou. Sure he\u2019s going to get this january window, but the way scouting has been for the last few years, i dont see any wonders happening with uniteds only hope for champions league football being europa, and even then, the non existent chance that we might win it in the next few years. Pogbye and haalandin will be the only two things happening
Stability on the transfer side. The 3 transfers we brought in have flourished. With Mou, there was no plan. We bought to just...buy in some cases (see Fred at \u00a352 million). Buying older players like Matic and Sanchez backfired on us as well. \n\nOle/Phelan and whoever else is working with them on transfers are trying to buy players they can develop/players that have more than 1 season of quality football left. Players that want to play for United and not for an inflated salary.\n\nSo maybe Ole/Phelan are better off in the DOF role than managing/coaching. Ole took over a squad he had no say in and we went on a hell of a run last year. Now let\u2019s see what he can do the rest of the year. We are 4 points off top 4 after one transfer window, not 15.\n\nI realize everyone\u2019s patience is wearing thin after all the bullshit we have had to put up with after SAF\u2019s retirement. We were hiring the wrong guys. Right now, I think we have a guy in place that can build us into a really, really good squad. But he needs time. Just my opinion.
You're delusional if you think Haland is a sure thing.
Plays well with no pressure, as opposed to a big game player.
Lol i was gonna say that as well
Lol me too. Reached office almost 1.5 hours late. :D
Agree but I feel like he already had enough chances and I don\u2019t see any improvement or any hope he will start contributing. Giving your all and playing with passion is one thing, but you can\u2019t have a player just for that.
I definitely feel like he's improved, but it's all relative. His assist, his presence at a useful spot followed by good intervention on the ball, that's what he needs to do more of. His decision making needs to be improved, but it's not as though it's a problem of his technicality, his 'talent', it's a problem partly of how strong he is, which is partly technique - how he engages with his opponent - partly strength and resistance training, and partly of how he is mentally, in terms of composure, decision making, and awareness. There's a big gap that he needs to make up, and I'm not sure he can. But it's not impossible.
It's not just CV and pedigree though is it. Under LVG and Mourinho they also looked like they'd never trained together.
But we were getting better results under them. So far, this season has been the worst for 30 years, team has never looked this lost or average and we seem to wait on the other team to let us play instead of forcing ourselves on them. I think we better, more qualified managers on the market, poch and allegri just to name 2,it would be silly not to make the change. Better managers have been sacked by Ed despite doing better. Ole has had a year, in which we went backwards if we are honest. Time to move on
No people who are this young are more fragile.. What you say is true for 20-25 maybe
You can't quantify your first sentence without the aid of stats to back your assertion. Fred's performances have been consistent for a while now with and without Mctominay. Prove otherwise. Show me the drop of in Fred's form without Mctominay with specific examples
Proceeding to call things delusional with no explanation - great argument.\n\nAnd if you can't be arsed to even explain your claims, fine, but don't act surprised when no one listens and downvotes you.\n\nThe fact that this was you reaction to a genuine question to have some discussion says a lot.
It doesn't have to be negative when losing thought, that's not how a fanbase works. That's not how anything works, it should always be positive, angry but positive. Saying this sub should be negative when losing is not a good Idea. Be angry be pissed off but don't down in the negativity.
Yeah not sure about that but that norwegian connect seems strong
[where have I seen this before?](https://twitter.com/Zonal_Marking/status/1210271840838524928?s=20)
Ahhh yes, someone else made a similar joke to me, I must have stolen it, it can't be that it isn't that creative to begin with and I'm sure you won't see it in this thread multiple times.\n\nYou have the link to the first \"Lingard is a young prospect\" joke?
Merry Chrismalling to you all.\n\nDownvote to hell.
Yea totally agreed.. He is such a bright spark this season.. Happy he is playing for us coz i would legit be jealous if he was playing for some other team
We do this over and over ,we get within touching distance of Chelsea then show our true colours and lose to relegation fodder, if any team will capitalise on Chelsea slipping up it's spurs
The opposite, we lose to lowly teams and drop down the table but when the big games come we show our true colours and climb to within touching distance of the top 4.
The season is long and spurs even under Mourinho haven't been great when they have every reason to be. Theres valid reasons why we havent been good at time and some unexplainable results as well but i think the top 4 battle won't be real until February. Stay in and around until then and hope a fit pogba can fire us to top 4.
We just beat Tottenham, they lost abysmally vs Chelshit, and we finally have Pogba back.
Pretty massive if given the inconsistency of this team
This inconsistency is expected. We have counted on Mctominay to hold our midfield together when prior to this season he wasn't even close to being a consistent starter. martial first season back at the 9 and rashford coming into his own this season like we never saw before. The only player coming into this season we could expect any level  of consistency with is pogba and he's been out. I think giving young players 4-6 months in a season to find consistency is fair given the unstable spot Mourinho left us in squad wise.
[removed]
[removed]
You would have thought last season would have given them both a bit of confidence with them being two of our most consistent players, especially with Wan-Bissaka and Maguire coming in as well but they've not really kicked on like we hoped. I wouldn't say they've been poor but they can both do a lot better.
3 points on Saturday is better than another 3 goals today.
Not really and I think Ole doesnt care about hat tricks since thats what SAF did with him as well
I think Norwich must be the 2nd one?
Brighton?
Mhmm.
I think the whole world knows this stat by now.
I don't really think we did much to draw them out. They sat back and basically didn't pressure us for the majority of the game IMO\n\nI'm glad for the result, but I don't think this was any kind of turning point for us personally
All that was different was Newcastle standing off our players in their low block. They applied 0 pressure and made no attempts to tackle or get tight. \n\nWe aren't getting better at beating the bus. We need better players to do that.
The kids exhausted because he is only 18
The difference is that Chelsea are gonna dump him and other youngsters eventually. They will splurge like crazy. That\u2019s all that they know.
Perhaps,  but so far,  regardless of recent results, it would seem Lampard is a capable coach.
We don't know this. Under Lampard they might take a different approach.
I fear for the day that they both have injuries at the same time
We'll have Greenwood Haaland partnership instead
Shhhhhh. We don\u2019t say that out loud here.
Yeah it was of course\n\nBut dammit I want my hat trick
That strike off the post.. Hnnnnnng
Read it again bro

I just need the scousers to lose once, imagine the scenes when they win the league going unbeaten
Hope we cunt their record. Fuckers need to be reminded no matter what they achieve, United will always be there to take them down
Could've been top 1 if we won every single match :(
r/technicallythetruth
And still only 2 points ahead of Liverpool lol, absolutely outrageous when you think about it
Your aunt could have been your uncle if she had a penis.
I like it better as \u201cand if my aunt had nuts she\u2019d be my uncle\u201d but still good
Who says she doesn't?
Lol. He literally was stood in the middle of the field like a director, pointing out where everyone else had to pass it to. \n\nThey mostly followed too.
Like he was conducting his own little orchestra there
When Pogba is back the squad runs through him, make no mistake about it.
He kept pointing at passing options when other players had the ball
He always has for me ever since Ibra left. Seeing them two play together was glorious, seriously the only two we had on that wave length at the time.
Have been trying to say this, particularly about players like Fred. Fred's \"good games\" have meant he's controlled midfield and moved the ball around.\n\nThat's not enough for a top side - that's the bare minimum. Players need to contribute by playing forward passes, making space, getting assists, and occasionally chipping in with a goal.
We had already taken the lead at that point so his shot didn\u2019t do as much for years team as you are suggesting but it was a good shot nonetheless.
Maybe so but when he takes a shot from distance its almost always off target
Its almost like their form was unsustainable. Don't they call it a 'new manager bounce' around here?
Well, except Leicester and Sheffield.
I'm hoping that other teams emulate Sheffield's playstyle. Would like to see overlapping CBs catch on.
Please kindly point out where I've said that?\n\nUnited is losing atm let's have an upvote party calling for ole's head is what I'm calling out. :)
I agree, seems kinda ridiculous to do that mid game regardless of the outcome, but either way it's not ridiculous to still be Ole out at all.
Good riddance. If you stop watching after 17 minutes and 1 goal, you're not a real fan.
Why can\u2019t people want ole out, guys clueless as a manager. The first 20minutes were fucking woeful and they are justified in what they said. Rest of the game was good much improved but ole still needs to go.
Clueless as a manager but has beaten Pep and Mourinho? Obviously he has a lot of things to improve on but get some perspective mate.
I'm calling out the people that straight up said they were switching off after just 15 minutes. They can get fucked. If you still want Ole out, while I don't agree, that's a justifiable opinion after this season, but not watching just because we go down is what I'm annoyed at.
These guys have a memory span of an actual fish, I swear\n\nNo matter how dreadful we are, one win and they're dancing with smiles on their faces ready to give Ole a lifetime contract\n\nUpd: now we will get downvoted, but that's because we just won. Two weeks later, after a couple of horrific performances, these same words would be upvoted to hell
Still think we should get Poch. Been here since PSG. Ain't going nowhere because one result this or that way.
The same Poch who just got sacked for not cutting it at Spurs, or a different one?
Yeah, people who don't change their opinion that easily are hear. It's just that we get downvoted to oblivion by the topred positivity brigade.
Go into hiding or be mass downvoted for having an opinion against the grain?
Nothing wrong with having that opinion but essentially trying to celebrate our manager being sacked is a bit weird.
Having an opinion is fine but some of the things people say are just embarrassing tbh
You got it
Why? It's one game. One game shouldn't be enough to sway you if you were Ole out before this game.
It's more then one game now already ain't it?spurs, city.\n\nIt seems to the negative cunts resetting the wins everytime is the norm
Having someone attack a cross like that is something we\u2019ve been crying out for since Lukaku left
Even then he still often picked the wrong pass and shot too often.
Yes, Shearer mentioned that a few time in commentary and was spot on.
Especially when it's against such poor opposition.
He wasn\u2019t shit. His decision making though is dreadful. That pass to martial when greenwood was in fucking acres of space made my blood pressure reach dangerous levels.
That was annoying, plays with his head down so he misses so many good options
Exactly. Newcastle were garbage but his decision making in tougher games will bone us.
He was shit relative to a good 10. It is crucial to pick the right passes in situations he's been at. For his standard and Lingard's he was decent. Just shows how we have absolutely no depth or class in that position.
Trying to get him a hat trick
He had some good moments.  That #10 position is the best place for him clearly but he's still quite a ways from what we need there.
He was.
He wasn't great, but not shit.
I watched the game, he was shit
Yes, whatever your view on Ole is I do give him credit for how he has managed Greenwood. The challenge with any young player who bursts on the scene is keeping their feet firmly on the ground and I do think Ole is able to do that with Greenwood in a way that wasn't done with Januzaj when he had his moment.
Ngl I do agree, but I don't want to keep on ragging on the guy as I end up sounding like a broken record when I do these write ups and also Ole's the one who picks him in the squad.
Ok fair enough. He so goddam frustrating to watch. I just don\u2019t get how someone can be so consistently awful. \n\nHe is not that bad a player, someone needs to teach him how to shield a ball.
Rashnaldo indeed
I don't know about other people, but I spend way more time watching this god damn club than I should.
I do too, I'm late to work today because I stayed up watching the match
Yeah. Like sure this was a good game, but the whole season is still abysmal. There is good tactical changes that made this game good. Somehow it's wrong to apreciate that if you've been criticising Ole this whole season.
Yeah. I don\u2019t get why people who want Ole just act like as if we\u2019re going to be on a long run of wins just be because we get the occasional victory. We\u2019re won consecutive league games only once all season and we haven\u2019t kept a clean sheet in 3 months
Do you criticise the players when we lose then?
Nope. If we lose, it's all on the coaching staff
I think James should be played in his preferred position in the left. All his 3 goals have come from that position.
Pogba just brings another dimension to our play honestly. I can't really pin point what it is specifically, but we look so much more threatening when he's on.
He draws defenders towards him simply because the threat he poses and that opens up spaces for the others.
Pass him the ball and he shields it so well, it\u2019s literally impossible to take it off him
Because he's a world class player.
And younger brother Matty has scored twice against us.  I do know that means shit.  Just felt like saying it.
That's what McSauce is for
Can\u2019t disagree with this. We\u2019ll desperately need to bring in someone else in January though.
Depends on the team. Against teams that sit back we don't need that extra midfielder.
That\u2019s true, however it can be very risky considering how the season has gone so far and Pogba\u2019s positioning in the last 20 minutes. He likes to drift forward, and today had a few instances where he left only Fred behind when Newcastle won the ball back.\n\nLuckily Newcastle gave up, but in a tight match that could be a huge weakness.
I'm sorry, I am, but he did the same he's done for months, same formation, same tactics, same players. Starting Greenwood was a must as James has looked tired as hell recently. Lingard for Pereira was a change he's made a bunch, almost a rotation at this point. \n\n\nNewcastle were dreadful! Goalkeeper error first goal (nice shot by Martial, great layoff pass by Pereira), Defensive catastrophe for Greenwood goal (great strike Greenwood), Weak in the air for Rashford goal (great header Rashford, soooo good to see)...\n\n\nI'm sorry there's no Ole masterclass here. Our players performed as they should, they reacted really well to going behind, and got the job done against a dreadful Newcastle performance. \n\n\nI am not Ole Out but do believe he badly needs to improve tactically, and I really want him to, would love him to be a wild long term success (love the guy).
And it changed in 2-3 years ffs
That's what a WC manager with strong support from the board gets you.
TAA is as good as KDB with his range of passing and crossing.
I hate how good he is
ahh so that's the secret.../r/redeevils needs to make sure you attend all the games!!
Could be Matic behind Pogba and Fred in a 4-3-3 if we need to sit deep, though Lingard does well as a pressing CAM in those games.
I'm in exactly the same boat as you and it stings so much. People use my backing of him to attack Ole and other opinions I've held on footballing matters. I'm sure people will use it to attack my judgement of non footballing matters too, soon.\n\nIt's nonsensical and pathetic from me as I've never met the man but I'm not angry, just really disappointed. He's let me down big time \ud83d\ude02
We were several goals up an just subbed off our two best attackers. Of course we were less dangerous lmfao. That\u2019s not lingards fault.
We had a spell where we passed the ball around for 10mins. I think JLingz was the only player not to touch the ball .
Our great DoF man Ed Woodward has seen no need to appoint another DoF, which means he has everything under control.\n\nDo not worry, fellow citizen!
We just gotta work together!
He also played a big part in the build up for Martial\u2019s first goal
If they can be consistent, then maybe Ole can concentrate on fixing the other areas.
that\u2019s true \n\ni\u2019d like a lot of investment in the midfield\n\nimo we need 2-3 more midfielders and we sell pereira and matic \n\nthat way we can rotate McTom, Pogs, Fred and the new signings
if you go with purely matches we won its 100%
Fair enough.  But I\u2019d say the PL is probably the most relevant statistic.  As I would imagine most fans would rather us win the Premier League than anything else.  That\u2019s how I feel anyway.  Cup wins are good,  don\u2019t get me wrong.  But I think the real measure of a team is the PL.
This is a stat I can get behind
That went in like a rocket even after the deflection
We\u2019re about 2 or 3 years away from a title challenge.\n\nMan Utds avg age of the starting squad this season is 24 years and 321 days. \n\nWhile both Liverpool and Mancity have avg age of 27 years and around 50 days for their starting eleven. \n\n The avg age of prem squad is 27 years and 275 days this season. \n\nSo if the law of averages hold, and the oft repeated saying is true, \u201cyou don\u2019t win anything with kids\u201d, then we\u2019re at least 2 years away from assembling a squad that can challenge for the title. \n\nWould also love to get stats on the age of squads that have won the league title over the past 10 or 20 years, which might blow an Ole shaped hole in my quick and dirty thesis.
I would love for us the challenge, but I don\u2019t think 2 players and 3 years does it. This Liverpool side haven\u2019t lost a prem game in 62 matches now. That\u2019s crazy. They are champions of Europe, club World Cup champions, and almost certainly have the league secured too. \n\nI hate it, but united are no where near that Liverpool team, for a number of reasons. As said before, we need a better manager, a DF, I would say 3-4 starters and then other squad players, and a good 4-5 years of solid positive football.
In the time until we acquire those key players, our current crop will have improved too. Dont forget how young our team is!\n\n\nHowever, i doubt itd be a successful leauge challenge. We need at least a couple years to get all the players to gel etc
You didn\u2019t get the hype because you don\u2019t seem to actually know a whole lot, one of those armchair managers as evidenced by your statement about us needing new players in all those positions.
That's a bit harsh, I think.\n\nWe've all got our options, right or wrong.\n\nI disagree with him, but I think many fans would agree that a right winger and two midfielders (to replace fellaini, Herrera and maybe soon Matic) would be good additions to our squad (as would I in those positions). \n\nThe striker role is debatable, but us needing something \u201cdifferent\" up front is something I've heard from fans and pundits alike, so you can't really slate him for that too much.\n\nThat would be 4 players, not far off from your 2-3.\n\nAnother CB is bullshit for me, but that's my opinion and I'm no more of an expert than he is.\n\nAs for the left back position I have to say I really rate Shaw, but he is injury prone. I'd like to say we can mount a challenge with him as starter and Young/Williams as his backup, if we fix the those other positions. But I don't think anyone is necessarily stupid for thinking we can't. Look at City who lost Laporte; suddenly they're not in the race anymore. I wouldn't blame a fan for thinking we could suffer the same way if we lose Shaw (which might happen, as he is prone to injury).\n\nTL;DR:\nMy point is that most of the positions he stated he wants us to have new players in are reasonable or at least justifiable, even if we don't agree with the guy you're responding to.\n\nI don't think it does our community any good to discredit others as \u201carmchair managers\" just because they have a different opinion.
Ur right. I think I'll  just go back to my hole.
Wish it was one though
Yeah! We need 3 quality additions to the team...with a midfielder being the priority! A few better players behind that front three and we would look very very dangerous!! Our current front 4 options can rotate really well...imagine if instead of lingard ole put on James for rashford down that left side!! I'm sure we would have seen another goal!! \n\nJust need to add a bit nore quality to the team!!
Love your optimism mate.  \nLet's start by winning next game and push for a top 4 position so we can attract the quality players you hope for.
What is scary is to think that it mostly depends on Ed
Perreira made the wrong pass at least twice when he could've easily set a teammate through to a great chance.
Pereira wasn't amazing; did alright but his decision making was still a bit shit.\n\nDe Gea didn't do anything wrong really but didn't have a lot to do either.\n\nShaw deserves credit but wasn't *amazing* either. A solid performance from him though.\n\nBasically everyone else played really well I thought; even those three were solid.
This and city away is the only hope
Nuno wilder jose ole masterclass incoming, hopefully.
Spurs are crap against top teams
Gave me a headache,Jesus.
Criscus Ronford
This is a stat I can get behind
and they are likely going to win it again next season as none of the challengers seem ready. Pep might leave city
Leicester just aren\u2019t at their level lol
Too true. But they really didn\u2019t look even top four material in that game. At home, with everything to play for, they just flopped entirely. Maddison, Youri, Evans, Chilwell, all these players that fans have a habit to purr over, looked atrocious. Only ones who came out looking good for me were Ndidi and the Turkish lad, and even he gave away a penalty.
24
I refuse to believe you watched the match.
Yep all 90 mins, what else you wanna know?
Best shot of the game.
Andreas shouldn't even be the second option, let alone a starter for us. He had his chances but he's just not good enough. He always seem to make the wrong choice in any situation.
He\u2019s making slow but steady improvement. He\u2019s a decent option in the squad, especially for the next couple of seasons with how many positions they need to sign for. That\u2019s not to say he\u2019s not one of the most obvious areas we can improve, but even after we sign, hopefully, a centre mid, an attacking mid, and a right forward, he can still be useful as relief.
Andreas was absolute pure garbage today. The only time he did a couple of good things is when we were 4-1 up.\n\nBefore that he constantly lost the ball, made the wrong decisions, useless fucking player.
He assisted Martial for his first goal. 'The only time he did a couple of good things is when we were 4-1 up'\n\nAgenda poster
Tonali looks quality but Italian players never seem to work out well for us :/
Their policy means they've got no choice
Not surprising when you think about it. Lingard is good at pressing but does not do well in tight spaces. Big teams generally leave more spaces between the lines so it's easier to press the more isolated centerbacks into mistakes. Passing is easy with so much space to work with particularly on the counter.\n\nBoth players have their niche, but yes Lingard shouldn't start in general. He should used like Park, for his energy in big games.
Football fans in general seem to have pretty poor impulse control.
As soon as we improve at beating the lower half teams instead of lowering ourselves to their level (or lower, lol) things will be looking so much brighter. We have seen that Ole's United can match or beat the best on a good day.
Beating the small teams should be standard, but we can't do it. Ole can't seem to dmset the team up right and we usually need to be sparked into life. The big teams play to suit us, leaving gaps in behind
I agree about waht you say about Rashford but today Martial played really well and at the end, that's what matters haha.\n\nAnd yes, AWB si very very predictible, but at least he has tried to go forward. He is not good tecnically but he is very fast and string so what he has done today, he can do it more times and the cross has been really good tbh.\n\nAnd shaw,, don't know man, everytime I look at him, he is walking and not running and out of position. Thinking about he is our first choice by far and the fact that he is in something like 200k a week... I can't with him haha
I\u2019ll give you the first 2 points but I think you should have a closer look at Shaw... he\u2019s not walking half as much as you think he is... he got forward so much today. Think \u00a3200k is about the going rate for a Man U player these days unfortunately
You asked whether you are just a hater - the answer is yes. You hate Shaw, and you are selectively noticing anything he does badly - look at his stats from tonight and you'll realise he had a pretty decent game. He covered a lot of ground so how you are getting that he didn't run I have no idea, he set up a goal by running with the ball past 2 players... stop hating on the guy, he's our best left back by a mile
> for me he didn\u2019t do anything that Rashford doesn\u2019t do every single game\n> \n> \n\nHe finished a 1-v-1, which I absolutely would have no confidence in Rashford doing.  It's small, yes.  And expected of a striker.  But, I feel like Rashford loses his head in those kinds of situations, whereas Martial has a calm state-of-mind.
I meant the work rate aspect of his game, Martial has been getting loads of attention tonight for doing something that Every other player does every game
Agreed, and I think that's a problem Mourinho had too: it's not clear how he wants to play, so it's not easy to know which players to recruit. The top teams have a way they want to play and recruit according to those needs.\nWe instead change our way of playing from week to week (Mourinho because he wanted to adapt to each opponent, Ole because it seems he hasn't settled on our best team or system yet).
Yeah, that's why it's so important to have a DOF. Him and the manager decide how they want to play and sign from that.\n\nBut this is one of the things why I don't think Ole is the right man. If you have pogba, you have to play with a 433, it's something that all the people know and don't know why since the start of the season he decided to play with a 4231, without singing any top CAM.\n\nIMO we should play with a 433 and sign someone to replace what Herrera was but it seems that we still don't know even what is our best formation haha
[removed]
This. Mistakes happen when you\u2019re faced with good play.
Agreed, I've enjoyed watching high intensity pressing from our side but sadly it didn't result in many touches inside the penalty box and that's a problem(due to lack of creativity /flair)
How is it sad that our pressing forced a lot of mistakes out of Newcastle?
There are system issues and personnel issues. If you take good players out of Liverpool or City, they\u2019ll just play the same way but won\u2019t be able to execute the plans. We have a system issue and a personnel issue. Good players won\u2019t make us win games consistently if our movement is bad, our passing sloppy, our pressing haphazard, and our defending shambolic
You look at other teams obvious flaws and they actually seem to be trying to do something about them instead of just repeating the same pattern over and over.
Yeah. I am 100 % Ole out, but I want to see Ole in another position. Maybe some kind of PR for the team or something. However, I am not sure if Poch wants to come. However, I believe that this club has more structure than Arsenal etc.\nWe will have to wait and see how the next transfer windows develop
Pogbas not a 10. I'm not sure why this is so difficult for some of you. We need to buy a proper 10 as soon as the window opens.
They base their opinions on Fifa.
Idk why but this comment made me piss myself \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02
But garner is inferior in terms of physicality. Timbo is quite aggressive and more built for the prem.
Fosu Mensah
Oh damm. Totally forgot about him, figured he was sent out on loan or something
Noway Greenwood should start. I think we'll play Fred Lingz and Pogba, with Rash and Martial and James
Probably. But James would be more useful against Arsenal, not impossible that Mason starts and Danny comes on after 55-60 minutes.
No he wasnt. You're being disingenuous.
Nah that\u2019s you. Every time McTominay has a good game you come out and say he\u2019s crap and say he\u2019s not enough but he keeps proving you wrong and how essential he is in our team.
2 halfs btw. Scott was injured pretty much the whole first half. Fred carried him
I doubt McSauce plays next match.
Nah, fred is a better midfielder than mctominay. Passion and desire can only get you so far.
Fred is wayy better than mctominay
He really is but you're downvoted because McTominay has 'heart' and 'passion'. Never mind his lack of ability on the ball
Wasn't great in the second? Everything went through him! He's streets above Mctominay the passion merchant
Lol, scott was injured the whole first half and fred had to carry him through it.
He got dispossessed leading to their first goal. So its not like he had a solid game.
I'd play Greenwood ahead of James
So would I,  had he not played 90 minutes and James rested.
I think James against the teams that will attack us and Greenwood against the rest is what Ole should do but seeing as he got 90 tonight I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll start against Burnley-probably isn\u2019t physically up to that much football in such a short space of time yet.
He was also hobbling a bit, safer to keep him for burnley
Seriously. I love ole, but results speak for themselves. I\u2019m not ole in or ole out, but I have no problem with fans being frustrated with him and wanting him out. Didn\u2019t he go like 10 games without a win ?
Huh?
[deleted]
I presume he was saying you can't call people plastic because you're American.
Who said that ?
[deleted]
I'm talking more about minutes than position.
Daniel James?
He was signed as an impact sub, even he's said he's played a lot more than he expected to
He can't play every game.
Pogboom then. Some long range shots from him should bring their defence forward.
Score first and we win.
If we can go hard from the whistle, and keep the intensity up if we don\u2019t score right away, I think we should win comfortably.  \nBurnley are tired as well, and we took key players off the pitch early last night. Our squad is also younger and should be fitter than theirs. Let\u2019s hope the supposed \u00abold school and out dated\u00bb running in pre-season will pay off tomorrow.
I think we won every game at Burnley and so did most of the top 6 teams, am I wrong?
\"Watford\"
Sorry you're right.\n\nI'm a moron lol
\n>I'm a ~~moron~~ optimist lol\nFTFY
I can see Arteta getting a win. Chelsea have flaws that are out there for all to see, and Arsenal have the tools to exploit them.
for THEIR first goal he was pivotal, I can tell you that much
Did you go blind for our goal?
Think we need to snap up chill we\u2019ll from Leicester
He was pretty rubbish against Liverpool, as was our would-be second-coming-of-Beckham, James Maddison.
Brandon Williams
Think we need to snap up chill we\u2019ll from Leicester
Newcastle deserved to be up 2-0 in those 15mins.
Wasn't Maguire brought in to deputize our defence?\n\nI'm not in the 'he's a poor signing' camp that I've seen bandied about here, but still.  I thought he'd solve us conceding these silly goals.
Who knows? I mean I haven't heard anything specific about the expected features of his performance. But from a fan POV, I personally would have had that hope - he appeared pretty dominant with Leicester. Alas, there seems much confusion in our defence. \n\nMy thinking is that Schmeichel or perhaps their defensive coaching was bringing about a leadership or united confidence in their back line. Whatever is was, it's lacking here.
Oh okay. That's actually smart. Didn't think about it that way.
We were unusually clinical today, that is true.\n\nNewcastle looked the stronger team until Martial sneaked in his first goal at the near post. If the keeper makes a better save (he really could have, he stepped the wrong way at first after all) that game could\u2019ve easily swung the other way like it has all season.\n\nNewcastle made horrendous mistakes for a top flight team, whether we pressed well or not
And if my aunt had balls she'd be my uncle.
No need to be upset! I\u2019m happy we won. And we\u2019ve definitely been unlucky this season so it balances out a little.\n\nBut I\u2019m right to be concerned that we looked abysmal against Newcastle for 20 minutes. If Newcastle actually rode their momentum without pissing it away, you\u2019d be the one mad in the post match thread at the team and not at me!
first 20 was awful, i do agree. \n\nbut i would argue that 2/4 of the goals we scored were mistakes from Newcastle forced to happen due to our incessant pressing. (Mason + Martial\u2019s 2nd).\n\nadded to Rashford\u2019s header - i\u2019ll gladly take a 3-1 win.
Might just be me, at this stage, I wouldn't want to be too concerned on the \"bad parts\" whenever we win the game.
Lol\n\nMy point is the scoreline suggests we dominated when that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. This sub is going to be aggravated beyond belief the next time we drop points from the exact same situation.\n\nI\u2019m capable of enjoying the win and recognizing we need to address the fact that we started so poorly. 4-1 shouldn\u2019t hide that
Yeah, we did start poorly, but to suggest Newcastle gifted us the win is a bit much IMO. We were all over them once we equalized. They were absolutely terrible after that. \n\nImagine we heard 50m for Longstaff last summer, hahaha.
But we did dominate? I felt bad the second half for Newcastle
I only watched the highlights so I can't really comment much but I do agree with you to a certain extent. The goals were more from opponent errors rather than our build-up play. \n\nThis team needs to actually concentrate for the full 90 mins and try not to give up stupid goals or play well when going behind. With abit more concentration and luck we should be able to grind a few more results. \n\nAnyway not gonna complain, a win is a win which is much needed after 2 abysmal results.
A terrible Pereira in DM is a better passer than Mctominay
I uhh... Beg to differ.
For you maybe, read this thread. So many people trying to berate fans that just aren't as excited as they are over one result.
Oh haha\n\nPersonally I'm waiting for a 5 games streak, haven't got that since the honeymoon. And very rarely under Mou.\n\nAnd I believe my expectations have become risibly low.. But then again, saying \"It's only Newcastle\" is very negative
I totally agree and I don't come on here to stomp on the team for no reason, however it's infuriating to see everyone's flippy flopping from week to week. There is a problem and it wont just go away, so why can't people see things in measure and context.
Fair enough man, nothing wrong with that. We all just want to win.
I used to be like that all the way this season and last but watching them failing against the worst team in the league was the final straw
That's understandable mate.. Here's hoping the team turns it around and gets back to where we belong
They're not that smart
It's actually the entire year and a half of inconsistent football  ,Watford was the tipping point , the game I lost all faith in the man
He hasn't even been here a year and a half
I'd agree hes was missing out a lot and can't expect full potential from him. If you like it better, I rate second half Fred above second half Pogba.
I'd rather say he was mediocre, I rate Freds performance today above his. (ofc not counting the shootings from distance) Fred worked harder, while Pogba was trying to succeed with key passes and through balls, but without a result. Like the smally tricky pass to Lingard at the end, or the lob (if such an English word exists) to Mata - which was a great vision, but wrong execution sadly.
Not at all, I think the youngsters pace is the future of our team, but I feel we lack the routine because we fill up mostly with younger players. (or we have the \"old\" ones in defence)
I'm curios why do you think it is?
The thing is, we didn't settle with \"seeing the game through\", we still performed with a relatively high level of intensity and were hungry for more goals and I applaud the team for that, but we failed to deliver, our passing and running was not fluid. I'm not shitting on this win, just expressing my nervousness toward the next match.
I watch because I love this team and I want them and Ole to succeed. And for them to succeed, they must be able to break down the low block consistently. Today, we won not because of that, but because Newcastle came out to play and were punished for their mistakes. On another day, it could have been Watford all over again. My criticism is fair and reasonable, I'm not trying to be negative at all.
You're complaining we didn't score more while we were up 4-1, that seems negative.\n\nI get your larger point.  But it's hard to score against teams when they pack their box!  Also leads to more randomness in results.  It's just good strategy for less talented teams that will, unfortunately for us, pay off for them sometimes.\n\nSo why feel confident we can crack a team that sits back on us?  First, we're more talented, and while it will work to slow us down, we will win more often over a larger sample.\n\nTwo, Greenwood will be playing more, and he is our best chance of just beating defenders heads up.\n\nThree, Shaw will get better as he returns to form.  He was our PotY last year for being able to transition from defense to offense.   Add him into a mix with AWB and Williams, and get Dalot on and Young off, and we can crack those teams better.\n\nFour, McGuire seems more willing to initiate offense.  We've been taking it up the wings fairly exclusively the past year.\n\nBut the biggest thing is getting Pogba back.  Say what you want about his consistency, he is one of the best in the world at unleashing those outstanding long passes up the middle.  He's an upgrade over everything we have in the midfield and takes those minutes away from everyone who isn't Fred or McT.  But more importantly, his ability to make the long pass forward is what we need to crack those squads that try and sit back on us.  He showed that against Watford but it was too little too late.
I don't want decent I want word class. If we want to compete with the best only Pogba is starting material out of those 3.
Awesome
Because you can do it on fifa!!
In pereires role
Is he better than pereira right now ?
Because there is no reason to be talking about Liverpool owning the league in our match thread when there is a Daily Discussion post available
It's also true
It was STUPIDITY
It was STUPIDITY
Fair enough. Thought you had stolen it from him since he said it about halfway through the game, but I stand corrected.
pogba? consistent? roflmao
Learn to read. Key word expect.
[removed]
We had only 42% possession that game
Hahaha wow we were efficient
lol, at home too
I don't know how to feel about Lampard right now. Chelseas squad is still pretty damn good and yet he has still struggled in a few games.\n\nInconsistent I suppose, a bit like us. Maybe due to the young squad? (although Chelsea has far more experience and depth in their squad).
I think Lampard is still learning, but he has the makings of a good coach, similar to OGS.
It was \"ice in his veins\" I assumed.
Well he was pretty calm while providing the assists for our goals.
He gets a \u00a320 bag of heroin for each goal scored.
I thought it was more of an 'inject this into my veins' kind of thing. Wouldn't be surprised if he got into trouble for it from the mardy twats at the PL
Celebrate like a knobhead against us, get fucked. Pardew says hello.
Literally the truth
What the hell is an \"Ole out upvote party\" even going to accomplish anyways lol?\n\nNot like Ed's reading this sub and shitting his pants because some redditor got all mad, it's ridiculous.
100% correct. I truly don\u2019t think it\u2019s his fault that we can\u2019t break down teams that just sit back as especially when pogba isn\u2019t fit, we just don\u2019t have the personnel to be able to do that. \n\nThen people will say \u201cwell why didn\u2019t he sign an attacking midfielder\u201d but i\u2019m sure he wanted to, and that\u2019s on the Glazers. The signings he has made have definitely improved our lineup and hopefully he\u2019ll be allowed to make a few more over the next couple windows, really hope the board get behind him!
Uhuh funny thing the person hasn't actually said what you're talking about. We're just calling out the reactionary morons.
I know, I'm relating to his words on Ole, which are absolutely true. He's clueless as a manager, you really have to be deluded af with all those dogmatic \"but he's a red devil\" approaches to not see it.\n\nIf it wasn't for his past achievements, this sub would be exploding with people wishing his departure
Nope, that is wrong. If you watch when the team gets it. It fucking beautiful. When they don\u2019t grasp it is terrible. That is why it is a process. We are seeing youth come up and make an impact. The academy is where we should look not our check book. Let\u2019s spend another billion and not get anywhere.
I agree that celebrating his sacking is weird but I was just pointing out that it's not really that people \"go into hiding\" but more that anything they say is immediately shoved to the bottom of the page. My stance hasn't changed but I've learned you can't have a real discussion here because of how people react after results in either direction
If you\u2019re Ole out, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. He\u2019s had one transfer market (no, last January doesn\u2019t count). He\u2019s got us right in the thick of top 4 and didn\u2019t have his best player for 3 months. The man deserves fucking time. Going for Poch or whoever is the \u201chot name\u201d is at the moment has fucked us since SAF retired. If you can\u2019t see that, I feel sorry for you.\n\nThis season was always going to be a rebuild. The squad had to be gutted and rebuilt by Ole after Mou. United should\u2019ve been able to bring in more players over the summer, but it\u2019s clear the Glazers/Woodward are holding back the club from doing that. So here we are. Ole bringing stability and taking time to rebuild the proper way. With youth and intelligent transfers.
That's fair enough. I don't agree with downvoting people for an opinion they have, that's just pointless. \n\nA lot of the time it can be how they present their opinion, if it is one that goes against peoples.
We've played well against top teams, because we can counter. But suck against poor teams. There's tons of evidence to support that.
Seems like a good time Charlie, plays relatively better when we're winning
What do you mean?
Loool he was shit , literally could\u2019ve scored 2 more goals if he just picked the right pass
Maybe my standards have been lowered because of his other performances.
Hello fellow Asian
Why hello
Absolutely need someone to provide depth and challenge for Fred. The man will be running on fumes in February if he can keep up this level of play.
Good point. Can have one of Scott or Fred sit back when we're attacking. Hopefully we'll get to the point where we won't need three midfielders for winnable games.
I remember the hate on this sub a few years ago saying  Klopp was doing it wrong and he wouldn\u2019t last at pool. He was running the players to death and they would never amount to anything doing it his way...
LMAO that's hilarious.
And time to rebuild without the axe hanging over his head
Being a WC manager usually earns you that privilege.
Now you know why we had the ball for 10 mins. /s
Tbh I don't care, taking it 1 win at a time no matter the game. I would be absolutely ecstatic if we could win ANY trophy this year, it all adds up.
I don\u2019t disagree.  I think you\u2019re missing my point.  There was a time when Liverpool were winning cups and we\u2019d said,  it doesn\u2019t matter,  we are better in the league,  I\u2019m just stating facts, my friend.  I just want us winning, period.
I may have been a bit harsh, I was just arguing against his point.
How many years of English did you take because I read through your last comment thinking you were just making fun of English fans.
***The usual nosh from the usual noshers***. I feel attacked.
Yeah thats kinda what I want. He should be a squad player but I\u2019m not comfy with him starting.
Truthfully, for him to start, he needs to do a lot more. With all the players the club could grab, if he doesn't start delivering assists and goals regularly, he won't last. It's just a sad fact for players at a club like this, there are decent players all over Europe that could come in, he'll have to compete with them and if he doesn't step his game up markedly he won't be in the team.
You are right I forgot he completed a 2 meter layoff without massively fucking it up like everything else.
He has to be in that position and evade markers just to be there, so you\u2019re definitely being harsh there.
Yeah but it shouldn't be impossible to accomplish this. It would be worse if we only beat the lower half teams and looked completely out of our depth against the top 6.\n\nEdit: add a couple signings so that we don't have to play the likes of Lingard, Mata and Pereira and we should be creating a lot more chances against poor teams.
It's a mentality thing that comes from the top. Team look devoid of spark and imagination. It looks like they don't train together, like a bunch of strangers waiting on a mistake or a moment of brilliance. That's from the manager. Any other man with his CV would never have got the job, and so far it's showing
I mean, I don't blame him for making 200k a week, I wish I was him haha. But if you look at Newcastle's goal, he  is not in his position and he is not running back. It was the 20th minute and of course the goal it's not all his fault, but a big part of it in my opinion yes
Think you should watch it again, he\u2019s up high because we were attacking then. He bombs it back into position whilst Maguire and Lindelof are the ones scrabbling around.. he\u2019s not at fault for not being able to track Longstaff either that was Fred\u2019s man..
Hmmm... fair enough.\n\nBut I'd rather intelligent runs, than energy-wasting runs.\n\nHis style-of-play pisses me off sometimes (coming to the ball, rather than running), but that is who he is.  I guess I can't blame him if it gets him goals, even if it isn't the most appealing thing to watch (as a fan!)
I'm talking about the touches in the oppos pen box.
FIFA lists him as CM/CDM. Don't forget his form at Juve before he came back. And he was used more in attacking there.
He doesn't mean they go by what fifa lists him as, they mean that on fifa pogba is a great number 10, because you can move players around and all that matters is their base stats, so they are assuming that because Pogba has \"82 shooting\" and \"90 dribbling \" on fifa, he will obviously be good at number 10, or because he scored some goals that means he can play there - the reason you see so many experts on tactics and players and positions is because of football manager and fifa- Pogba's position is left of a midfield 3. We don't play 433 though, so his next best position is a part of the 2. We have tried him at 10 several times and our fanbase seems to forget that- he isn't a good 10, he needs to be on the ball more and deeper with space.
Considering Mason played 90 mins yesterday! And is 18 years old. That would be irresponsible imo but what do I know
Depends on his condition after last night, might be possible for him and James to play one half each. I think he is much more useful against a low block.
We didn't really play that hard in the 2nd half though. Also, being young means you can play more games without being tired.
keeps proving me wrong how? Fred has outperformed him in recent games. McTominay's passing is atrocious. He's rated by 'top reds' because he's an academy product who 'gets the club' and 'has heart and passion'. In reality he's a decent squad player but nowhere close to a player that should be starting for a team challenging for top honors. How has he proved me wrong?
Fred played better when McTominay\u2019s work rate is on the pitch. That\u2019s evident enough from the games played this season but you chose to ignore that. Also, SAF and Jose Mourinho publicly rated McTominay and so does Ole, not just your so called  \u2018top reds\u2019. I think you and I know who\u2019s opinion holds more weight.
Also, managers will hardly say bad things about their players. Fergie thought Jones could go down as one of uniteds greatest players. Jonny Evans too.
That\u2019s some low iq thinking, I lived in Manchester for a time lol
But there is a Burnley is a tough place to myth
Absolutely. I hope we can beat Burnley now.
By a country mile
Exactly
We absolutely destroyed them though, one of the best performances this season imo.
Yeah honestly could\u2019ve been 6
Wrong Longstaff, sorry.
That could be it too, I was just making a guess because I wasn't sure
How exactly is he clueless?
If you're asking such questions there's no point in even trying to explain, I've repeated these words so many times on this sub I'm actually tired of it.\n\nPeople saying they distance themselves from this sub when we're losing, I'm doing the opposite - after every win this place explodes with fake positivity and delusional takes
Bro stability is the one big thing we lack, its been a year, behind on points compared to mou. Sure he\u2019s going to get this january window, but the way scouting has been for the last few years, i dont see any wonders happening with uniteds only hope for champions league football being europa, and even then, the non existent chance that we might win it in the next few years. Pogbye and haalandin will be the only two things happening
Stability on the transfer side. The 3 transfers we brought in have flourished. With Mou, there was no plan. We bought to just...buy in some cases (see Fred at \u00a352 million). Buying older players like Matic and Sanchez backfired on us as well. \n\nOle/Phelan and whoever else is working with them on transfers are trying to buy players they can develop/players that have more than 1 season of quality football left. Players that want to play for United and not for an inflated salary.\n\nSo maybe Ole/Phelan are better off in the DOF role than managing/coaching. Ole took over a squad he had no say in and we went on a hell of a run last year. Now let\u2019s see what he can do the rest of the year. We are 4 points off top 4 after one transfer window, not 15.\n\nI realize everyone\u2019s patience is wearing thin after all the bullshit we have had to put up with after SAF\u2019s retirement. We were hiring the wrong guys. Right now, I think we have a guy in place that can build us into a really, really good squad. But he needs time. Just my opinion.
You're delusional if you think Haland is a sure thing.
Plays well with no pressure, as opposed to a big game player.
Lol i was gonna say that as well
Lol me too. Reached office almost 1.5 hours late. :D
Agree but I feel like he already had enough chances and I don\u2019t see any improvement or any hope he will start contributing. Giving your all and playing with passion is one thing, but you can\u2019t have a player just for that.
I definitely feel like he's improved, but it's all relative. His assist, his presence at a useful spot followed by good intervention on the ball, that's what he needs to do more of. His decision making needs to be improved, but it's not as though it's a problem of his technicality, his 'talent', it's a problem partly of how strong he is, which is partly technique - how he engages with his opponent - partly strength and resistance training, and partly of how he is mentally, in terms of composure, decision making, and awareness. There's a big gap that he needs to make up, and I'm not sure he can. But it's not impossible.
It's not just CV and pedigree though is it. Under LVG and Mourinho they also looked like they'd never trained together.
But we were getting better results under them. So far, this season has been the worst for 30 years, team has never looked this lost or average and we seem to wait on the other team to let us play instead of forcing ourselves on them. I think we better, more qualified managers on the market, poch and allegri just to name 2,it would be silly not to make the change. Better managers have been sacked by Ed despite doing better. Ole has had a year, in which we went backwards if we are honest. Time to move on
No people who are this young are more fragile.. What you say is true for 20-25 maybe
You can't quantify your first sentence without the aid of stats to back your assertion. Fred's performances have been consistent for a while now with and without Mctominay. Prove otherwise. Show me the drop of in Fred's form without Mctominay with specific examples
Proceeding to call things delusional with no explanation - great argument.\n\nAnd if you can't be arsed to even explain your claims, fine, but don't act surprised when no one listens and downvotes you.\n\nThe fact that this was you reaction to a genuine question to have some discussion says a lot.
It doesn't have to be negative when losing thought, that's not how a fanbase works. That's not how anything works, it should always be positive, angry but positive. Saying this sub should be negative when losing is not a good Idea. Be angry be pissed off but don't down in the negativity.
Yeah not sure about that but that norwegian connect seems strong
We scored 4 goals, the best Christmas gift ever.\n\nNow, let's go LEICESTER!!
A day late, but Merry Christmas to my fellow Reds!
Merry Chrismalling to you all.\n\nDownvote to hell.
Ahhh yes, someone else made a similar joke to me, I must have stolen it, it can't be that it isn't that creative to begin with and I'm sure you won't see it in this thread multiple times.\n\nYou have the link to the first \"Lingard is a young prospect\" joke?
Fair enough. Thought you had stolen it from him since he said it about halfway through the game, but I stand corrected.
Yea totally agreed.. He is such a bright spark this season.. Happy he is playing for us coz i would legit be jealous if he was playing for some other team
We do this over and over ,we get within touching distance of Chelsea then show our true colours and lose to relegation fodder, if any team will capitalise on Chelsea slipping up it's spurs
The opposite, we lose to lowly teams and drop down the table but when the big games come we show our true colours and climb to within touching distance of the top 4.
The season is long and spurs even under Mourinho haven't been great when they have every reason to be. Theres valid reasons why we havent been good at time and some unexplainable results as well but i think the top 4 battle won't be real until February. Stay in and around until then and hope a fit pogba can fire us to top 4.
We just beat Tottenham, they lost abysmally vs Chelshit, and we finally have Pogba back.
Pretty massive if given the inconsistency of this team
This inconsistency is expected. We have counted on Mctominay to hold our midfield together when prior to this season he wasn't even close to being a consistent starter. martial first season back at the 9 and rashford coming into his own this season like we never saw before. The only player coming into this season we could expect any level  of consistency with is pogba and he's been out. I think giving young players 4-6 months in a season to find consistency is fair given the unstable spot Mourinho left us in squad wise.

You would have thought last season would have given them both a bit of confidence with them being two of our most consistent players, especially with Wan-Bissaka and Maguire coming in as well but they've not really kicked on like we hoped. I wouldn't say they've been poor but they can both do a lot better.
3 points on Saturday is better than another 3 goals today.
Not really and I think Ole doesnt care about hat tricks since thats what SAF did with him as well
I think Norwich must be the 2nd one?
Brighton?
Mhmm.
I think the whole world knows this stat by now.
I don't really think we did much to draw them out. They sat back and basically didn't pressure us for the majority of the game IMO\n\nI'm glad for the result, but I don't think this was any kind of turning point for us personally
All that was different was Newcastle standing off our players in their low block. They applied 0 pressure and made no attempts to tackle or get tight. \n\nWe aren't getting better at beating the bus. We need better players to do that.
The kids exhausted because he is only 18
